$par5
The purpose of this document is to present user requirements
and a high level specification of a Prototype mill/drill link for the ANC system.
This document is a baseline: a first approach to writing modular links in a PASCAL based system.
Development of master links for use in a production environment will draw upon  this prototype.
In the production environment in which the master links are used, it is
envisioned that User Requirement
Documents will be produced but on a smaller scale--perhaps only a few pages
which differ from the User Requirement Document of a master link.

2.1 General Description
$ind left +4
$ski
The target machines of this effort are the Kearney and Trecker Milwaukee-Matic family, consisting
of Models 180, 200, 600 and 800.
Machine tool axis nomenclature is based on the standard Cartesian coordinate system for all models.
The X-axis is horizontal, the Y-axis is vertical, the Z-axis extends from front to back,
and the B-axis rotates about the Y-axis.
$ski
$ind left -4

------------------------------------
$just left
$ski
Collision Zone: The collision zone is the area in which the spindle head can collide with the table.
To avoid this collision zone, the Y-Axis slide must be at a position greater than
2.88 inches (74 mm) while the Z-Axis is less than 6.50 inches (165 mm) or vice versa.
$ski
Tables are of either 1 or .001 (rotary) degree indexing resolution.
$ski
RPM range is from 4 to 4000 rpms with a tapping range of 4 to 800 rpms.
$ski
Feedrates are .1 thru 400 IPM for linear motion in .1 increments, .1 thru 100 IPM for contouring
in .1 increments.
The table is indexed at 5400 DPM (15RPM).
$ski
The miscellaneous function M06 (automatic tool transfer) will cause the Y-axis to move at rapid
traverse to 15 inches (382.2 mm).
$ind left -4
$page
2.3 Models 200/600
$ski
$ind left +4
There are two sets of axis travel limits available, the larger one is an option which can be
purchased.
The two sets follow:

Collision Zone: The collision zone is the area in which the spindle head can collide with the table.
To avoid this collision zone, the Y-Axis slide must be at a position greater than 5.90 inches
(150 mm) while the Z-Axis slide is less than 8.50 inches (216 mm), or vice versa.
$ski
Tables are of either 1 or .001 (rotary) degree resolution.
$ski
There are three headstocks available, giving three different available RPM ranges.
Each of the three has a tapping range, in which the spindle is restricted to a
subset of the range generally available.
The three ranges follow:
$ski
$ver
     Non-tapping            Tapping
        Range                Range

      5 - 5000       |      5 - 507
----------------------------------------
$just left
$ski
If a spindle speed of 10 RPM or less is commanded, all axis motion will be inhibited.
$ski
Feedrates range for linear motion from .1 to 400.0 IPM in .1 IPM increments, .1 to 100.0 IPM for
circular interpolation in .1 IPM increments, and 1 to 999 DPM for rotary motion in 1 DPM increments.
$ski
The miscellaneous function M06 (automatic tool transfer) will cause the Y-axis to move at rapid
traverse to 12.00 inches (304.8 mm) for Model 200 and to 11.5 inches (292.1 mm) for Model 600.

Collision Zone: The collision zone is the area in which the spindle head can collide with the table.
To avoid this collision zone, the Y-Axis slide must be at a position greater than 4.00 inches
(100 mm) while the Z-Axis slide is less than 19.50 inches (495 mm), or vice versa.
$ski

1.\\&Leader&
$ski
$par4
Tape leader is a length of tape consisting of one character, repeated sufficiently to call
attention to itself.
This character is ignored by the control and is used exclusively by the machine operator.
$ski2
$ind left-4
2.\\&RWS Code&

$par4
The rewind stop code is a character which causes the tape rewind mechanism to halt.
$ski2
$ind left-4
3.\\&EOB Code&
$ski
$ind left+4
The end-of-block code signals the beginning of control-readable data on the tape and is the last
character in every tape block.
$ind left-4
$ski2
4.\\&Block Delete Code&
$ski
$ind left+4
If block delete mode is selected on the control console, any block beginning with this code
will be ignored.
$ind left-4
$ski2
5.\\&Sequence Number&
$ski
$ind left+4
General form: N'n'
$ski
$par4
'n' is a number from 0000 to 9999.
It identifies blocks on a tape, e.g. for editing purposes.
$ind left-4
$ski2
6.\\&Table Letter Address&
$ski
$ind left+4
P, D, or T
$ski
$par4
These three letters refer to one of three tables within the control's memory which can be loaded
from tape prior to the execution of a machining tape.
The three tables respectively contain information concerning
$ind left+4
1.\\Tool length compensation
$par
2.\\Cutter diameter compensation
$par
3.\\Tool pocket information.
$ind left-4
$ski
$par4
For more information about these three topics, refer to the "Ancillary Functions" portion of
section 3.2.
These tables can be loaded manually from the control console.
$page
$ind left-4
7.\\&Table Entry Number&
$ski
$ind left+4
$par4
For loading the control's memory with tool length or cutter diameter compensation information,
this number refers to an entry within the corresponding compensation table, ranging from 1 to 100.
$ski
$par4
For loading the control's memory with tool pocket information, this two digit number refers to
the pocket number in which a particular tool has been loaded.
$ind left-4
$ski3
8.\\&Comma&
$ski
$ind left+4
$par4
This is the single code assigned to the punctuation character comma.
It separates the table entry number and table entry value.
$ind left-4
$ski3

$ski
$ind left+4
$par4
For loading the control's memory with tool length compensation or cutter diameter compensation
information, this number is the value to be entered into the entry specified by the Table
Entry Number in the table specified by the Table Letter Address.
$ski
$par4
For example:
$par
$ind left+4
$ski
P06,5000
$ski
$ind left-4
will load a value of .5 inches (mm) into entry 6 of the table of tool length compensations.
Negative values are allowed.
$ski
$par4
For loading the control's memory with tool pocket information, this value is the tool number
located in the pocket specified by the Table Entry Number.
$ski
$par4
For example:
$par
$ind left+4
$ski
T15,4444
$ski
$ind left-4
means that tool number 4444 is in pocket 15.

10.\&Control Out Code&
$ski
$ind left+4
$par4
Messages to the operator can be included in a machining tape.
When the control interprets the information from a tape and encounters a message, that message will
be printed on the control's display.
$ski
$par4
The Control Out Code signals the beginning of a message and is a left parenthesis for EIA coded
tapes and a percent sign for ASCII coded tapes.
$ind left-4
$ski3
11.\&Message Initiation Code&
$ski

$ski
$ver
$ind left +4
G00  X 'x'  Y 'y'  Z 'z'  B 'b'  F 'f'
G01
$ski
$just left
G00 (positioning mode) specifies hockey stick motion with automatic deceleration near the end of
the motion.
Modal. Cancelled by G01.
$ski
G01 (continuous interpolation) specifies linear motion with no attempt to decelerate near the end
of the motion.
Modal. Cancelled by G00, M02 or M30.
$ski
'x', 'y', 'z', and 'b' specify the absolute coordinates of the motion (in G90 mode) or the motion
distance (in G91 mode).
(See descriptions of Absolute and Incremental Modes in "Mode Setting", portion 19 of this section.)
$ski
'f' specifies the feedrate to be applied to all axes.
It is a four digit number ranging from 000.1 to the maximum feedrate possible in steps of .1, in
Inch Mode (see "Mode Setting", portion 19 of this section) using a 3.1 format.
In Metric Mode, the value ranges from 3 to the maximum feedrate possible in steps of 1 using a 4.0
format.
$ski
The value programmed with F is either interpreted as a direct feedrate (distance divided by time)
or as "inverse time" (velocity divided by distance) based upon the feedrate mode, G93 or G94 (see
"Mode Setting", portion 19 of this section).
$ski
$ind left +4
If 'f' = 0 then all axes will move at rapid traverse with no attempt to make the axes arrive at
their endpoints simultaneously.
An F0 cannot be specified on a block containing a circular interpolation command (see "Circular
 Motion", portion 15 of this section).
$ski
If 'f' > 0 then all axes will move at the rate specified by 'f' and arrive at their endpoints
simultaneously.
$ind left -4
$ski
$ski
F codes are modal and will remain in effect for subsequent blocks until another F word is
programmed.
$page
The B word specifies motion of the table.
The format for 'b' is 3.3 for both inch and metric mode.
The sign of 'b' determines whether the motion is clockwise (positive) or counterclockwise
(negative) as viewed from the top of the table in both Absolute and Incremental modes (see "Mode
Setting", portion 19 of this section).
$ski
One variety of table is only capable of rapid motion to 72 equidistant points (an "indexing
table"); thus, its smallest increment of motion is 5 degrees.
Another variety of indexing table can position at one degree intervals.
Still another variety of table is capable of more accurate positioning (.001 degree increments) and
can move at a variety of speeds, specified by the F word.
$ski
When table motion is programmed in a block with motion in the X, Y and Z axes, the X, Y and B
motions will occur simultaneously, followed by the Z motion.
$ski
In G93 mode (see "Mode Setting", portion 19 of this section), when B is the only axis motion in a
block, the table will rotate as rapidly as possible, regardless of the feedrate (F word) in effect.
In G94 mode (see "Mode Setting", portion 19 of this section) solitary B axis motion with an F word
will be interpreted as degrees per minute, using a 3.0 format, ranging from F1 to F999 (or F0).
$ski
When linear motion is programmed in the same block as table &indexing& the feedrate must specify
rapid traverse (F0).

G02 specifies clockwise circular interpolation.
$ski
G03 specifies counterclockwise circular interpolation.
$ski
$ski
G17 specifies motion in the XY plane, the condition in effect when the control is started.
$ski
G18 specifies motion in the XZ plane.
$ski
G19 specifies motion in the YZ plane.
$ski
X, Y, and Z specify the endpoint of the arc.
If the endpoint specified is exactly the same as the current tool location, then 360 degrees of arc
is commanded and that position must be explicitly programmed (in Absolute mode, the absolute
position and in Incremental mode, zeros for the axes in the plane of contouring--see "Mode
Setting", portion 19 of this section).
$ski
In Absolute mode (see "Mode Setting" portion of this section), I, J, and K specify the absolute
location of the center of the circle; in incremental mode (see "Mode Setting" portion of this
section), I, J, and K are the distance from the starting point to the center of the circle.
The starting radius (defined by I,J, and K) must equal the ending radius (defined by X, Y, and Z).
$ski
F specifies the feedrate as described in "Linear Motion", portion 14 of this section.
The maximum feedrate allowable for a circular motion block is 100 Inches Per Minute, (2500 MMPM).
$ski
No table motion (B word) is allowed on a circular motion block.
Tool length compensation (see "Ancillary Functions", portion 21 of this section) cannot be in
effect for circular motion in the YZ or ZX planes.
The minimum radius allowed is .001 inches.

$ind left +4
Helical motion makes use of Circular Motion (see "Circular Motion", portion 15 of this section)
but has a third motion component normal to the two which form the arc.
The resultant motion forms a spiral shape, or helix.
All remarks made about circular motion apply to helical motion.
$ski
The axis (X, Y, or Z) which is not in the plane of the arc specifies the linear distance to be
traversed concurrent with the cutting of the arc.
The offset (I, J, or K) which is not in the plane of the arc specifies the ratehe linear cut
(measured in rise per radian).
For more accurate feedrate control, Helical Motion should be performed in G93 mode.

$ski
These G functions represent a sequence of rapid and feed linear motions to accomplish various types
of drilling, boring, and tapping operations.
$ski
A canned cycle is programmed by a block with a canned cycle G code (G81-G89), the location at which
the operation is to occur in the XY plane (X and Y words), the Z axis clearance plane (R word), and
the final Z depth (less R).
Canned cycles operate as follows:
$ski
$ind left+8
$par-4
1.\\A rapid motion to the XY location
$par-4
2.\\A rapid motion to the Z axis clearance plane
$par-4
3.\\The particular canned cycle specified by the G code at the modal feedrate and spindle speed
$par-4
4.\\Rapid retraction to the Z axis clearance plane.
$ind left-8
$ski
Following a canned cycle operation, the same cycle may be repeated by entering a new position (X,
Y and/or B).
The cycle will be repeated at the new position.
Canned cycle repetition is cancelled by programming G80 in a block by itself, or by programming a
block specifying a different canned cycle.
Each block in which G81-G89 is programmed must contain X,Y,R,Z and E (if G83 or G87 is programmed).
$page
New values for R and Z may be programmed with any canned cycle block.
When a new R word is programmed, the canned cycle motion described above occurs as follows:
$ski
$ind left+8
$par-4
1.\\If the new R word is less than that previously in effect, the tool will position rapidly to the
X and Y location specified and then to the Z axis clearance plane.
$ski
$par-4
2.\\If the new R word is greater than that previously in effect, the tool will  retract rapidly
to that greater Z axis location and then position rapidly along the X and Y axes.
$ind left-8
$ski
A description of the particular canned cycle specified by the G codes G81-G89 follows:
$ski
$ind left+8
$par-4
G81-&Drilling&: The tool feeds the distance specified by the Z word and retracts rapidly back to
the point at which the feed motion began.
$ski
$par-4
G82-&Spotfacing&: The tool feeds to within .010 of the Z depth.
The spindle speed is changed to 100RPM and the remaining Z depth of .010 is drilled at .5 inches
per minute.
The tool pauses for a time (&not& under tape control) and is retracted rapidly back to the point
the Spotfacing cycle began.
The spindle speed will be restored to the speed in effect before the cycle changed it.
$ski
$par-4
G83-&Chipbreaking&: The tool feeds the distance specified by the E word, pauses for a time (&not&
under tape control), and feeds another increment specified by the E word until the total distance
specified by the Z word has been reached.
The tool then retracts rapidly to the point where the cycle began.
$ski
$par-4
G84-&Tapping&: The tool feeds to the depth specified by the Z word.
The spindle rotational direction is reversed and the tool pauses sufficiently long to achieve 80%
of the programmed RPM.
The tool feeds back to the point at which the cycle began and the spindle is reversed again.
$ski
$par-4
G85-&Reaming&: The tool feeds the distance specified by the Z word and then feeds out the same
distance.
$ski
$par-4
G86-&Boring&: The tool feeds the distance specified by the Z word, the spindle is stopped and the
tool rapids out the same distance it fed in.
The spindle is then restarted.
$ski
$need9
$par-4
G87-&Deep Hole Drilling&: The tool feeds the distance specified by the E word, retracts rapidly
to the point at which the cycle began, advances into the part to within .100 of the last E depth at

divided by time.
The maximum feedrate for circular interpolation (see "Circular Motion", portion 15 of this section)
is 100 Inches Per Minute (IPM) (or 2500 MMPM) in .1 IPM (1MMPM) increments.
For rotary motion without concurrent linear motion, the F word format is 3.0, ranging from 1 to 999
Degrees Per Minute (DPM).
Simultaneous linear and rotary occuring in which the rotary axis motion is greater than 10% of the
linear travel can most accurately be specified in G93 mode which cancels G94.

$ski
$just left
The S word specifies the rotational speed of the tool in revolutions per minute, as a four digit
number.
A speed of at least 10RPM is required to enable axis motion.
The directions of the rotation is specified by the miscellaneous functions M03 and M04 (see
"Ancillary Functions", portion 21 of this section).
The M40 is not required but if programmed will restrict the RPM to a selected range of rpms for
tapping.
Otherwise, the entire spindle speed range is accessible.
$ind left-4
$page
21.\&Ancillary Functions&
$ind left+4
$ski2
Ancillary Functions control a variety of machining operations and modes.
Generally they are specified by an M word selecting the desired function, e.g. turning on coolant,
starting spindle rotation, changing tools, etc.
$ski
For the purposes of this section, ancillary Functions are defined to be those
functions specified by M codes (the "miscellaneous functions", see below for a
complete list) and also some
other codes which fall into the same "ancillary" category, i.e. Cutter Diameter
Compensation, Tool Length Compensation and Tool Selection.
Descriptions of each of these functions follow.
$ski
$ind left+4
$par-4
G41-&Cutter Diameter Compensation LEFT&.
Commands the control to position the tool to the left of subsequent motion.
Modal.
Cancelled by G40 or G42.
$ski
$par-4
G42-&Cutter Diameter Compensation RIGHT&.
Identical to G41 except motion is compensated rightward.
Modal.
Cancelled by G40 or G41.
$ski
$par-4
G40-&Cutter Diameter Compensation OFF&.
Cancels G41 or G42.
G40 must be programmed with motion and is modal.
$ski
$ind left-4
$ind left+6
$par-6
Note:\Cutter Diameter Compensation allows the operator to dynamically correct the
machining motions commanded by a tape containing CDC G codes (G41 and G42) by
entering correction values into registers on the control.
CDC is only operational in the XY plane.
It can only be in effect with linear and circular motion.
Offsets (see "Mode Setting", portion 19 of this section) can be in effect.
The minimum axis motion necessary to apply (G41/G42) Cutter Diameter Compensation
(sometimes called "ramping" due to the gradual application of the compensation
during motion) and the minimum axis motion necessary to cancel (G40) Cutter
Diameter Compensation is .10 inches (2.54 mm); the minimum time for ramping is .2
seconds.
Ramping cannot occur with circular interpolation (see "Circular Motion", portion
15 of this section).
$ski
The amount of Cutter Diameter Compensation to be applied to motions subsequent to
the application of G41 or G42 is specified by the D word in the block containing
the G41 or G42.
The number with D ranges from 1 to 100 and refers to a register in the control's
memory which can be loaded from the control console or by a special tape (see "Table
Load Block Body" in section 3.1, Diagram of Tape Format).
$ind left-6
$page
&Tool Length Compensation&
$ski
Controlled by the P word, the control can dynamically change the Z axis value for
all motions in a tape.
P is programmed in the block with the first Z axis motion which is to be changed
and can range from 0 to 100 (P0 cancels the compensation).
The numbers 1 to 100 refer to one hundred registers in the control's memory set
by the operator.
For example, if the value -7.500 were entered in P register 3 and a tape block
with G90 G00 Z9.1 P3 were read, the control would position the Z axis to 1.6,
compensating for a difference in the length of the tool the tape was programmed
for the actual tool length.
$ski
Values can either be entered into the P registers from the console or by a special
tape--see "Table Load Block Body" description in the Diagram of Tape Format,
section 3.1.
$ski3
&Tool Selection&
$ski
Tools are stored in a magazine which can be rotated under tape control.
A particular tool in the magazine can be selected to be the next tool transferred
into the spindle (an operation also under tape control).
When a tape block contains a tool code number, (a T word) the magazine will rotate
until the proper tool has been selected.
Such selection may require more time than that required to complete th other
operations specified by that block.
In that case, subsequent blocks will be executed while magazine rotation continues.
$ski
At the point in the tape where tool transfer is required (specified by an M06 on
tape), the control will wait until the tool has been selected, if that process
is not complete.
$ski
Tools can be coded in three ways so that the control can select the proper one
from the magazine: octal coding, binary coding and pocket coding.
$ski
In octal coding, tool select codes are five digit numbers from 00001 to 77777
for a total of 32,767 possible tool numbers.
Tools are identified by fifteen rings (ones) and spacers (zeros) on the collar
of each tool holder which is read from the shank end by a tool reading head as
the magazine is rotated.
$ski
The binary coding scheme is similar to octal.
It consists of a four-digit number following the T code, ranging from T0101 to
T3131 for a total of 1023 codes.
The first two decimal digits are the group number, the second two are the tool
number.
Ten rings and spacers are read from the shank end of the tool to form the four
digits: the first digit of the group number is coded by two positions containing
either a ring or a spacer, the second digit by three positions.
The tool number digits are formed similarly.
$ski
In both binary and octal coding schemes, the magazine rotates until a tool with
a combination of rings and spacers matching that of the tool called for in a
preselection T word is located.
$ski
Machines which are not equipped with a tool reader head (for use of octal or binary
tool holder coding) can use tapered shank tooling in which the T word is a one to
seven digit number, ranging from 1 to 8388607.
With this scheme, the operator loads tools into the tool storage magazine and
assigns each tool code (T number) to the corresponding pocket number in which it
was placed (see "Table Load Block Body" definition in the Diagram of Tape Format,
section 3.1).

this prototype link is to be made, will not be supported.
They are included here for completeness only.
$ski3
$ind left+4
$par-4
M23-&Advance Table&: To afford greater flexibility in machining large workpieces,
it is possible to position the table in one of two positions, colinear with
the Z axis.
An M23 will advance the table toward the column holding the spindle.
It will only be acted upon when the table is oriented in one of the following
positions:
0, 5, 175, 180, 185, 355 degrees.
M23 must be alone in a block.

M24 must be alone in a block.
$ski
$par-4
M60-&End of Program&. Same as M30 except no rewind.
Only available for machines equipped with the Pallet Shuttle option.
$ski
$para-4
G25-&Automatic Regrid Cycle&. When programmed with the sequence Z
(retracted and keylocked), M06 (select tool probe), and a P
register all followed by the G25 will automatically command the
axis slide (XYZ) to position to the Target Bushing, placing
the probe tool aproximately 0.3" away from the front surface
of the bushing. The Z-axis will advance until the tool probe
contacts the face of the bushing. It will then attempt a form
of dead reckoning through sensing to determine if the machine
has lost exact absolute location (usually through expansion
and contraction).
$ski
$par-4
G26-&Surface Detection&. Similar to G25 except used to find true
absolute positioning of a part surface in respect to the axis
desired. A G98 block is normally used to correct any inconsistencies found.
$ski
$para-4
G27-&Automatic Position Between Surfaces&. Similar to G26 except
used to find the center point between two surfaces in the X or Y axis. 
$ski
$para-4
G28-&Coordinate(X,Y,Z) Detection&. Similar to G27 except it will
verify the location of a previous programmed command. A feed
of 200 IPM or less is recommended, and it is not to be 
programmed with a fixed cycle (G81 through G89).
$ski

G37-&Cancel Storage of Inspection Data&. Cancels G36. (Modal).
$ski
$para-4
G38-&Tool Check(Broken Tool Detection)&. When programmed with a
S-word (indicating the total number of blades to be checked
in one revolution of the cutter), the proximity switch will
not be triggered if the cutter is broken and an alternate
tool is required. To program, X,Y and Z are positioned to
within 1.0 MM (0.040") of the proximity switch and a RPM
is programmed (here the S-word indicates RPM) along with
a M03 (spindle ON clockwise). In the next block the G38
along with a S-word with a value equal to the number of
blades or flutes in the cutter are programmed to activate
the tool detection cycle. A S-word is not necessary for a single point cutter.
$ski
$para-4
G51-&Adaptive Control ON&. This directive, when programmed with
an H-word, will maximize the feeds and speeds in respect
to the most efficient tool performance. This is accomplished
by the information found in the H-word. The H-word is of
a four digit format where the first digit represents the type of cutting material.

The following link minor words have been identified as context-free
words, and as such their relative chronology can be specified
when programmed with any major word.
These minor words are SEQ, DWELL, XOFF, YOFF, ZOFF, TOFF, OSTOP, SPINP, STOP, STOPS, BD,
BD/ON, BD/OFF, and TOOL.
