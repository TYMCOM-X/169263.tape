          1  Introduction             ____________


              The SCRMAC package is a set of PMF macros designed  primarily
          for  writing section structured documents.  When using the macros
          PMF is used as a preprocessor to Scribe.

              The SCRMAC package provides  three  advantages  in  preparing
          documents:

              1.  Key-in  time  is  reduced; SCRMAC macros have the
                  potential to emit several Scribe commands  for  a
                  single macro call.

              2.  The  macros  are flexible and permit easy changes
                  to the controlling parameters to allow variations
                  in designing documents, and yet

              3.  SCRMAC  provides some standardization to document
                  design.






























          Introduction

          2  General Information             _______ ___________


              This section provides an overview of the use and functions of
          the SCRMAC Package.



          2.1 Preparing to Use the SCRMAC Package

              When  preparing  a document for use with SCRMAC the #DOCUMENT
          macro (described fully in Section 4.1.1) must be  called  exactly                                                   ____             _______
          once  at  the  beginning  of  the  document.  This  will make the
          necessary initializations to SCRMAC and emit several initializing
          Scribe  commands which include the setting up of the title, date,
          page number, margins, page length, and page width.



          2.2 Available Functions

              SCRMAC is set up  primarily  for  use  in  designing  section
          structured documents.  #SECT is a macro which is provided to flag
          and set up a new section of text.

              The macros #BEGINLEVEL and #ENDLEVEL are used in  conjunction
          with   #SECT  to  "level"  sections  (e.g.,  this  section,  2.2 
          Available Functions, is one level below, i.e.  contained in,  the
          section 2. General Information).

              A  macro  #PAR  is  provided  so  that  new paragraphs may be
          started and spaced properly within sections.

              For text which is desired to  be  put  in  Scribe's  verbatim
          mode,  the paired macros #BEGINFIGURE and #ENDFIGURE may be used.
          In addition to emitting Scribe's $VERBATIM command  they  provide
          indenting and spacing options.

              For  constructing  lists  of  "items"  the macros #BEGINITEM,
          #ITEM, and #ENDITEM are provided.

              Margins  may  be  easily  changed   and   reset   using   the
          #BEGINMARGIN and #ENDMARGIN macros.

              A  macro  called  #APPENDIX  is included so appendices may be
          used in the document neatly.  They are  handled  very  much  like
          #SECT handles sections.

              A  macro  called #TITLE_PAGE_1 is provided to setup a a title
          page for documents.

              Level one section titles and appendix titles may be placed as
          footnotes to the sections text by using the macro #FOOTNOTES.


          General Information






          SCRMAC User's Manual                                      Page 3
          November 16, 1981


              A  table of contents macro, #TOC, emits Scribe commands which
          set up a table of contents containing entries  for  each  of  the
          sections and appendices in the document.

              A #MEMO macro is provided to generate a standard memo heading
          for memos.



          2.3 Changing Default Values

              #DOCUMENT initializes many SCRMAC values used by other macros
          in  the  SCRMAC  package.  These  initial  values  are called the
          default values.  SCRMAC includes several macros which enable  the
          user to change these default values to suit personal needs if the
          default values set  in  #DOCUMENT  are  not  convenient.  Default
          macros  are  provided to change section, paragraph, figure, item,
          margin, table of contents, and tab default values, and are called
          #SECT_DEFAULT,   #PAR_DEFAULT,   #FIGURE_DEFAULT,  #ITEM_DEFAULT,
          #MARGIN_DEFAULT, #TOC_DEFAULT, and #TAB_DEFAULT respectively.



          2.4 Resetting Default Values

              Once default values have been changed using a  DEFAULT  macro
          they  may  be  changed  back to the values they had preceding the
          last DEFAULT macro call.  To do this the POP macro is used  which
          corresponds   to   the   DEFAULT   macro   used.  (e.g.,  If  the
          #TAB_DEFAULT was used to change  the  tab  default  values,  then
          #TAB_POP  macro  will reset the default values to the values they
          held preceding the last #TAB_DEFAULT call.)

          3  Operating Instructions             _________ ____________


              This section  describes  the  operating  procedures  for  the
          SCRMAC Package.



          3.1 On ADP and TYMSHARE


              The  following sections describe how to run SCRMAC on ADP and
          TYMSHARE.



          3.1.1 Running SCRMAC
              Prepare the document using the  SCRMAC  macros.  To  run  the
          SCRMAC program enter one of the following at the monitor prompt:

              On ADP:         .RUN RND:SCRMAC                               ___ __________

              On TYMSHARE:    .DO SCRMAC                               __ ______


              SCRMAC  will  respond  by printing the version number and the
          version date, and then prompt the user with an asterisk, "*".

          SCRMAC, version-number  version-date
          *


              To exit SCRMAC press the carriage  return  immediately  after
          the asterisk prompt:

          *<cr>           ____

          EXIT




          3.1.2 SCRMAC Commands
              The SCRMAC program accepts command lines of the form:

          [<output file> = ] <input file> [/<program>:(<option list>)]*

          If  the <output file> is omitted, the program takes the file name
          from the input file.  If  input  or  output  extensions  are  not
          specified,  SCRMAC  assumes ".PMF" for the input file, and ".TXT"
          for the output file.




          Operating Instructions






          SCRMAC User's Manual                                      Page 5
          November 16, 1981


              After the command line is entered SCRMAC does some processing
          and  then  runs  PMF  to preprocess the file for SCRIBE, which is
          subsequently run to produce  the  final  document  text.  Options
          other  than  those  used  by SCRMAC may be specified by using the
          option list form given above, where <program> is either "PMF"  or
          "SCRIBE"  (either may be abrieviated to one or more letters), and
          <option list> is a legal option list for the  specified  program.
          The   default  options  used  by  SCRMAC  when  running  PMF  are
          "/LIB:SCRMAC/NOPASCAL" .  SCRMAC does not use  any  options  when
          running SCRIBE.

          NOTE: The  syntax  for  option  lists  is very rigid:  slash (/),
                <program name>, colon (:), <legal option list> enclosed  in
                parenthesis.  There  should  not  be any blanks between the
                slash and the closing parenthesis of the option list.




          3.1.3 SCRMAC Actions
              After  a  command  line  is  entered,  SCRMAC,   after   some
          processing, will run PMF to preprocess the input file for SCRIBE.

              PMF  will  print  its  name,  version number and version date
          after the  user's  command  line.  After  PMF  has  finished  its
          processing, it will then run SCRIBE to produce the final document
          text.

              As does PMF, SCRIBE will print its name, version number,  and
          version  date  after  the  PMF  version information.  When SCRIBE
          finishes its processing it will then return control to SCRMAC.

              SCRMAC reprints its name, version number, and  version  date,
          and then prompts the user for another command line.

              After  processing  one  command line the terminal output from
          SCRMAC will be:

          .SCRMAC, version-number  version-date
          *<command line>
          PMF, version-number  version-date
          SCRIBE, version-number  version date

          SCRMAC, version-number Version-date
          *

          3.2 On the VAX


              The following sections tell how to run SCRMAC on the VAX.



          3.2.1 Running SCRMAC
              Prepare the document using the SCRMAC macros and  place  them
          in a file with the extension ".PMF".  At the monitor prompt, "$",
          enter

               SCRMAC <filename>               ______ __________

          where <filename> is the name of the file without the extension.                                                   _______



          3.2.2 SCRMAC Commands
              There are no SCRMAC commands on the VAX.



          3.2.3 SCRMAC Actions
              SCRMAC will run PMF and SCRIBE which will produce  the  final
          text  file  "<filename>.TXT".  SCRMAC  leaves  the  user  at  the
          monitor prompt.

          4  Macro Descriptions             _____ ____________


              The SCRMAC maros are divided into  two  groups:  1)  function
          macros  (macros  which emit Scribe commands to perform a specific
          function), and 2) default  macros  (macros  used  to  change  the
          default values used by the function macros).



          4.1 Function Macros


              The following is a list of the function macros of SCRMAC.  If
          the macro has parameters  they  are  listed  and  their  function
          described.  If  a parameter is omitted in a macro call the action
          taken is detailed under the macro description and is specific  to
          that parameter of that macro.

          4.1.1 The #DOCUMENT Macro

              #DOCUMENT(the_title,date,page_length,left_margin,page_width)

              The #DOCUMENT macro sets several document wide parameters and
          must be called once at the beginning of the document.  The  first
          parameter  is  the  title;  the second parameter is the date (see
          below); the third  parameter  is  the  page  length;  the  fourth
          parameter  is  the  left  margin size; the fifth parameter is the
          page width (as would be specified in a Scribe $WIDTH directive).

              PMF text quotes ,'<:' and ':>', should be used to bracket any
          parameter which includes commas.  For example, the date parameter
          "June 22, 1981" should be specified in  the  #DOCUMENT  macro  as
          follows:

              #DOCUMENT(This Is The Title,<:June 22, 1981:>,,5)

              Note  in  the  above example that commas must be used to omit
          any non-trailing parameters (above:page length is omitted).

              #DOCUMENT emits several Scribe directives which set the  page
          length,  the  left  margin  size, the page width, the default tab
          values, and also sets page numbering off (i.e., $NUMBER  OFF).  A
          title  directive  is  also  emitted  which  places the title left
          justified and the date left  justified  on  the  line  below  the
          title.

              Default  values  used by #DOCUMENT for omitted parameters are
          as follows:

              the title        defaults to the null string;
              the date         defaults to the null string;
              the page length  defaults to 66;
              the left margin  defaults to 10;
              the page width   defaults to 75.

              Omitting the title parameter causes the  #DOCUMENT  macro  to
          omit the title, date, and page numbering throughout the document.

          4.1.2 The #SECT Macro

              #SECT(title)

              The  #SECT  macro  should  be  used  at the beginning of each
          section.  The title of the section is the only parameter.

              The action of the #SECT macro is generally as follows:  lines
          are skipped before the section title using a $SKIP directive, the
          section number and title are then emitted, a  table  of  contents
          entry  is  emitted,  and  a number of lines are skipped after the
          title before the section text begins (using a $SKIP directive).

              The number of lines skipped  before  and  after  the  section
          title  varies  depending  on  the  current  section level.  $SKIP
          directives are emitted for  skipping  before  and  after  section
          titles using the current default values.  Initially the #DOCUMENT
          macro sets the default values as follows:

          Level One     pages before section title  - skips 2 lines after
          Level Two     skips 3 lines before        - skips 2 lines after
          Level Three   skips 2 lines before        - skips 1 line after
          Level Four... same as Level Three
          (for an explanation of Levels see #BEGINLEVEL macro description)


          NOTES:


                1. The first line of the first  paragraph  of  the  section
                   will  be indented according to the current default value
                   used by the #PAR macro.
                2. #SECT guarantees that at least two lines of section text                                         __ _____
                   will be on the same page as the section title.
                3. To start level one sections at the top of a new page the
                   default value for  skipping  before  level  one  section
                   titles must be equal to or greater than the page length.

          4.1.3 The #BEGINLEVEL Macro

              #BEGINLEVEL

              The  #BEGINLEVEL  macro should be just before any #SECT macro
          which begins a lower level section.  It emits a Scribe $LEVEL  +1
          command  and  internally keeps track of the current level for use
          by other macros.

              In case the idea of levels is still confusing here is a short
          example:  A  lower level section is one which is contained in the
          section above it.  For example,  we  have  a  Level  One  section
          entitled "The Alphabet", i.e.,

              2.  The Alphabet

          Two  sections  in "The Alphabet" may be "The Consonants" and "The
          Vowels".  They would be  at  Level  Two  (one  level  below  "The
          Alphabet") and would be titled as follows:

              2.1  Consonants
              2.2  Vowels

          Two  sections  in  the section "Vowels" may be "The Letter A" and
          "The Letter E".  These two sections would be Level Three sections
          and would be titled as follows:

              2.2.1  The Letter A
              2.2.2  The Letter E


              After  the  #DOCUMENT macro the level is automatically set to
          Level One; therefore, it is not necessary to  use  a  #BEGINLEVEL                                      ___
          macro  before  Level  One  sections.  Also it should only be used                                                               ____
          when a new level is started, not before each  lower  level  #SECT
          call   (i.e.,   a   #BEGINLEVEL   should   be   used  before  the
          #SECT(Consonants) macro call, but not  before  the  #SECT(Vowels)                                            ___
          macro call).

          4.1.4 The #ENDLEVEL Macro

              #ENDLEVEL

              The  #ENDLEVEL  macro  should  be  used whereever the sec
          level should increase.  The Scribe directive $LEVEL -1 is emitted
          and internal bookkeeping is done.

              Using  the  example in the #BEGINLEVEL description, after the
          last section in 2.1 Consonants, say "The Letter Z"  section,  the
          #ENDLEVEL  macro should be used to return to Level Two from Level
          Three before the #SECT (Vowels) is used.



          4.1.5 The #PAR Macro

              #PAR (lines_before, first_line_indentation)

              The #PAR macro should be used at the beginning of a paragraph
          which is not the first paragraph of a section (i.e., it should be                   ___
          used to separate pargraphs within sections).  The first parameter
          is  the  number of spaces to skip before the beginning of the new
          paragraph text.  The second parameter is the number of spaces  to
          indent the first line of the paragraph.

              #PAR emits Scribe commands which do the necessary spacing and
          indenting using the $SKIP and $PARAGRAPH  directives.  #PAR  also
          assures  that  at least the first two lines of the paragraph will                         __ _____
          be on the same page.

              If either of the parameters are omitted  #PAR  will  use  the
          current   #PAR   default   value  corresponding  to  the  omitted
          parameter.  #DOCUMENT initially sets these default values to skip
          one  (1)  line before the new paragraph, and not indent the first
          line (indentation = 0).  These  default  values  may  be  changed
          using  the  #PAR_DEFAULT  macro.  If the user wishes to omit both
          parameters #PAR() should be used, thus forcing #PAR to  use  both
          of the current default values.

          4.1.6 The #BEGINFIGURE Macro

              #BEGINFIGURE (lines_needed, indentation,
                                                 lines_before, lines_after)

              The  #BEGINFIGURE  macro  may  be  used before text requiring
          Scribe's verbatim mode.  The first parameter, if given,  will  be
          used  as  the  argument  for the $NEED directive to insure enough
          lines remain for the figure before a page break; if  omitted,  no
          $NEED  directive  will  be  omitted.  The second parameter is the
          relative number of spaces the  figure  should  be  indented.  The
          third parameter is the number of lines to skip before the figure,
          and the fourth parameter is the number of lines to skip after the
          figure.

              The   initial   default  values  for  the  second  and  third
          parameters are 5 and 1, respectively.  The current default values
          for  these  parameters  will  be  used  if  a  parameter  is  not
          explicitly  given  in  the  #BEGINLEVEL  call.  If   the   fourth
          parameter  is  omitted,  but  the  third  parameter is given, the
          number of lines skipped after the figure  will  be  the  same  as
          before  the figure; if both parameters are omitted default values
          will be used.  These default values  may  be  changed  using  the
          SCRMAC #FIGURE_DEFAULT macro.



          4.1.7 The #ENDFIGURE Macro

              #ENDFIGURE

              The #ENDFIGURE macro must be used following any verbatim text
          which was preceded  by  the  #BEGINFIGURE  macro.  There  are  no
          parameters  required.  #ENDFIGURE emits Scribe directives to skip
          lines after the verbatim  text,  readjust  the  indentation,  and
          begin to justify the text again.

          4.1.8 The #BEGINITEM Macro

              #BEGINITEM( text_indentation, skip_before_each_item,
                          start_number, skip_before_list, skip_after_list)

              The  #BEGINITEM  macro  is  used  before a section of text in
          which the #ITEM macro is used to form a list of items.  There are
          five  possible  parameters  to  the  macro  which all use default
          values if the parameter is not explicitly given  with  the  macro
          call.   The   first  parameter  to  #BEGINITEM  is  the  relative
          indentation of the text of an item.  The second parameter is  the
          number  of lines to be skipped before each item in the list.  The                                                ____
          third parameter is the number of the first item of the  list.  If
          the  user  does  not wish to have the items of the list numbered,
          then zero (0) should be specified as the parameter.  If the  list
          to  follow  is a continuation of the last list, then specifying a
          negative number as the parameter will  continue  the  consecutive
          numbering  from  the  previous lists last number.  The fourth and
          fifth parameters specify the number of lines to be skipped before
          the  first  item of the list, and after the last item of the list
          respectively.

              The initial default values for the #BEGINITEM parameters  are
          set  in #DOCUMENT and will perform the following actions if used:
          the text of an item will be indented four spaces from the current
          margins;  no  lines  will  be  skipped  before  individual items;
          numbering of items will be turned on and will begin with one (1);
          one  line  will be skipped before the first item of the list; one
          line will be skipped after the  end  of  the  list.  The  default
          values  for  #BEGINITEM may be changed by using the #ITEM_DEFAULT
          macro.

          4.1.9 The #ITEM Macro

                  #ITEM( label )

              The #ITEM macro is used to specify items of a list.  The only
          parameter  is  a label for the item.  If a label is given it will
          be placed to the left of the item text following the item  number
          (if items are being numbered).  Labels will be used only if given
          explicitly with the macro call; #ITEM()  should  be  used  if  no
          label is desired.

              When  using  the  #ITEM  macro,  text  for  the  item  should
          immediately follow the closing parenthesis  of  the  #ITEM  macro
          call:

              #ITEM()this text immediately follows the macro call
              #ITEM() this text does not immediately follow the macro call

          If  a  space  is  placed  between the closing parenthesis and the
          beginning of the item text then the text indentation can  not  be
          guaranteed to be consistantly correct.

              Four types of lists may be formed using the ITEM macros.  For
          examples of the different types of  lists  see  "A  Sample  Using
          SCRMAC" at the end of the User's manual.



          4.1.10 The #ENDITEM Macro

              #ENDITEM

              The #ENDITEM macro is placed at the end of a list which began
          with the #BEGINITEM macro.  It will make necessary adjustments to
          return to normal text justification and save the last item number
          in case the list numbering is to be continued with the next list.
          #ENDITEM has no parameters.

          4.1.11 The #BEGINMARGIN Macro

              #BEGINMARGIN(left indent, right indent,
                                            skip before, skip after)

              The  #BEGINMARGIN  marco  is  used around blocks of text that
          should be indented relative to the current margins.  The block of
          text enclosed between the #BEGINMARGIN and #ENDMARGIN macros will
          be indented from both the left and right margins according to the
          user's  specifications  (or  the  current  default  values  if  a
          parameter is omitted by the user).  The first  parameter  is  the
          number  of  spaces  from  the  left margin to indent.  The second
          parameter is the number  of  spaces  from  the  right  margin  to
          indent.  The  third  parameter  specifies  the number of lines to
          skip after  the  #BEGINMARGIN  call,  and  the  fourth  parameter
          specifies the number of lines to skip after the #ENDMARGIN call.

              Any  or  all of the first three parameters may be omitted, in
          which case  the  current  default  value  for  the  corresponding
          parameter  will be used.  If the third parameter is given but the
          fourth omitted, the number of lines skipped after the  #ENDMARGIN
          call  will  be  the  same as those skipped after the #BEGINMARGIN
          call.  If both the third and fourth parameters are omitted,  both
          current  default  values are used.  If all parameters are omitted
          "#BEGINMARGIN()" should be used.  The default  values,  initially
          set  in  #DOCUMENT  to  be  5,  5,  1, and 1 respectively, may be
          changed by using the #MARGIN_DEFAULT macro.



          4.1.12 The #ENDMARGIN Macro

              #ENDMARGIN

              The #ENDMARGIN macro, pairing with a #BEGINMARGIN call,  will
          restore  the  margins  to  the  columns  to  which  they were set
          immediately before its matching #BEGINMARGIN call.  There are  no
          parameters to #ENDMARGIN.

          4.1.13 The #APPENDIX Macro

              #APPENDIX (the_title)

              The  #APPENDIX macro is used to generate an appendix heading.
          Its only paramter is the  appendix  title.  The  Scribe  commands
          emitted  will  page, skip two lines, write a title, do a table of
          contents entry, and skip two lines before the appendix text.  The
          first  line  of the text following the appendix title is indented
          as it is for the #SECT macro.

              The title used in both the text and in the table of  contents
          is  the  exact title given as the parameter to #APPENDIX.  If the                   _____
          user wishes the title to read "Appendix A - Letter Games" it must
          be stated explicitly as the parameter.



          4.1.14 The #TITLE_PAGE_1 Macro

              #TITLE_PAGE_1( title1, title2, foot1, foot2, foot3, foot4 )

              The  #TITLE_PAGE_1 macro is used to generate a title page for
          a document.  There are six possible parameters to the macro,  all
          of which default to the null string if not given explicitly.  The
          first and second parameters, if given, will be placed centered on
          the  page  approximately  one  third  down the page with one line
          separating them.  The last four parameters will be placed each on
          separate  lines, left justified, approximately ten lines from the
          bottom of the page.

              The #TITLE_PAGE_1 macro may be placed in only  two  locations
          in the original text:  immediately after the #DOCUMENT macro , or                                 ___________
          as the last line of the text after the #TOC macro.  If it is  not
          placed  in  one of these two places the page numbers of the final
          document may not be correct.

              For an example of how the title  page  is  formatted  by  the
          TITLE_PAGE_1  macro  see  the  example  document  "A Sample Using
          SCRMAC" at the end of the User's Manual.

          4.1.15 The #FOOTNOTES Macro

              #FOOTNOTES( instruction )


              The #FOOTNOTES macro is used to have level one section titles
          and  appendix  titles  placed as footnotes on the bottom of pages
          containing the section's text.  The only parameter to  the  macro
          is  an  instruction  to  tell  where to place the footnote on the
          page.  Possible instructions for #FOOTNOTES are:  "LEFT" to  have
          the  footnotes  placed  left  justified;  "CENTER"  to  have  the
          footnotes centered between the  margins;  "RIGHT"  to  place  the
          footnotes  right  justified.  The instruction "OFF" will turn the
          printing of footnotes off on subsequent pages.  (Instructions  to
          #FOOTNOTES may be in either upper or lower case.)

              It  is  recomended  that if the #FOOTNOTES macro is used that
          all level one sections be  started  on  a  new  page.  This  will
          insure that the footnotes and the sections on a page correspond.



          4.1.16 The #TOC Macro

              #TOC

              The  #TOC  macro  is used to generate a table of contents and
          should be  the  last  line  of  the  document  file.  It  has  no
          parameters.   It  emits  Scribe  commands  to  generate  a  "nice
          looking" table of contents.

              Level 3, Level 4,..., Level n table of contents  entries  are
          indented  to  the  right  relative to section entries of the next
          lower level.  The initial indentation default value  is  a  three
          space  quantum  for  each  level over Level 2.  This value may be
          changed using the #TOC_DEFAULT macro.

          4.1.17 The #MEMO Macro

              #MEMO ( to, from, date, subject, CC)

              The MEMO macro can  be  used  to  generate  a  standard  memo
          heading.  The  parameters  above,  from left to right, correspond
          to:  the person or group the memo is addressed to; the person  or
          group  sending  the  memo; the date of the memo; the topic of the
          memo; and, if needed, who gets carbon copies of the memo.

              This is the only SCRMAC  macro  that  does  not  need  to  be                                                          ___
          preceded by the #DOCUMENT macro as long as no other scrmac macros
          are used to produce the memo.  The only optional parameter is the
          "CC"  parameter.  If  omitted  MEMO  will  omit the corresponding
          heading line on the memo heading.

          4.2 Default and Pop Macros



              The DEFAULT macros are used to change the default  values  of
          macros  which are initially set in #DOCUMENT.  Each DEFAULT macro
          also has a corresponding POP macro  which  restores  the  default
          values  back to their values immediately before the last matching
          DEFAULT call.  A POP macro should never  be  used  without  being
          preceded by a matching DEFAULT macro.

              If a parameter is omitted in a DEFAULT call the default value
          for that parameter remains unchanged unless otherwise noted.  POP
          macros have no parameters.

             NOTE:  A  default  value  is  used by a macro only if two
                    conditions hold:  1) a parameter is omitted in the
                    macro   call,   and   2)    the  parameter  has  a
                    corresponding default value.  If  a  parameter  is
                    given  explicitly  in a macro call, the given will
                    always  override  the  default   value   for   the                    ______
                    parameter.



          4.2.1 The SECT Default and Pop Macros

              #SECT_DEFAULT(skip before Level 1  section titles,
                            skip after  Level 1  section titles,
                            skip before Level 2  section titles,
                            skip after  Level 2  section titles,
                            skip before Level 3+ section titles,
                            skip after  Level 3+ section titles)

              The  #SECT_DEFAULT  macro should be used to reset the default
          values used by #SECT to space around section titles.  The  first,
          third,  and  fifth  parameters,  if  specified,  will  change the
          default values for the number of lines skipped before the section                                                         ______
          titles  for  Levels  One, Two and Three or greater, respectively.
          Similarly, the second, fourth and  sixth  parameters,  if  given,
          will  change the default values for the number of lines specified
          after the section  titles  for  Levels  One,  Two  and  Three  or          _____
          greater, respectively.  #SECT_POP is the restoring macro.

          4.2.2 The PAR Default and Pop Macros

              #PAR_DEFAULT (skip before, indent first line)

              The  #PAR_DEFAULT macro will set new default values for those
          used with the #PAR macro.  The first parameter, if given, changes
          the default value used to skip lines before the paragraph text is
          started.  The second parameter, if specified, changes the default
          indentation  for  the  first  line of the paragraph (this default
          value is also used by #SECT to indent the first line of the first
          paragraph of the new section).  #PAR_POP is the restoring macro.



          4.2.3 The FIGURE Default and Pop Macros

              #FIGURE_DEFAULT (new indentation, lines before, lines after)

              The  #FIGURE_DEFAULT  macro sets new default values for those
          used by #BEGINFIGURE and #ENDFIGURE.  The first parameter changes
          the  number  of  spaces  the  verbatim  text is indented if it is
          specified.  The second and third parameters  change  the  default
          values  for  the  number  of lines skipped after the #BEGINFIGURE
          call and after the #ENDFIGURE call respectively.  #FIGURE_POP  is
          the restoring macro.



          4.2.4 The ITEM Default and Pop Macros

              #ITEM_DEFAULT ( text_indentation, skip before each item,
                                start number, skip before list, skip after list)

              The  ITEM_DEFAULT macro allows the user to change the default
          values associated with the ITEM macros.  The first  parameter  to
          the macro changes the relative indentation of the item text.  The
          second parameter allows the user to change the  number  of  lines
          skipped  before  each item of the list.  The third parameter will
          change the number of the first item  of  the  list;  if  zero  is
          specified  the  default  value  will be to turn numbering off, if
          negative list numbering will default to continuing numbering from
          the last list.  The fourth parameter to #ITEM_DEFAULT changes the
          number of lines skipped before the first item on  the  list.  The
          last  parameter  specifies  the number of lines to skip after the
          list.  #ITEM_POP is the restoring macro.

          4.2.5 The MARGIN Default and Pop Macros

              #MARGIN_DEFAULT (new_left, new_right,
                                                lines before, lines after)

              The #MARGIN_DEFAULT macro changes the default values used  by
          the  #BEGINMARGIN  and  #ENDMARGIN  macros.  The first and second
          parameters specify the number  of  spaces  the  margins  will  be
          indented  relative  to the current margins for the left and right
          margins respectively.  The third parameter, if given, will change
          the  number of lines to skip after the #BEGINMARGIN call.  If the
          fourth parameter is given, its value will be used for the  number
          of  lines  to  skip after a #ENDMARGIN is found.  The #MARGIN_POP
          macro is the restoring macro.



          4.2.6 The TAB Default and Pop Macros

              #TAB_DEFAULT (tab 1, tab 2,..., tab 8)

              The #TAB_DEFAULT macro enables the user to change the initial
          standard  tab  stop settings of 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57 and 65.
          Scribe allows users to set up to eight tab stops, therefore eight
          parameters  are  possible (tab 1,..., tab 8).  In accordance with
          Scribe, all tabs encountered after the last  tab  stop  specified
          will  be  treated  as blanks.  When changing the tab stop default
          values all eight parameters need not be specified; however,  only
          trailing parameters may be omitted.  For example, if

               #TAB_DEFAULT (10, 20, 30)

          is specified, the Scribe command emitted will be:

               $TABS    10, 20, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35

          #TAB_POP is the restoring macro.



          4.2.7 The TOC Default and Pop Macros

              #TOC_DEFAULT ( new level 3...N toc indentation quantum )

              The  #TOC_DEFAULT  macro is used to change the indentation of
          Level 3 ...  Level N section titles in  the  table  of  contents.
          Beginning  with  Level  3  section  titles, the table of contents
          entries are indented to the right  one  indentation  quantum  for
          each  successive  higher  level section title.  There is only one
          parameter to this macro and it corresponds to the new indentation
          quantum  for  these  table  of contents entries.  #TOC_POP is the
          restoring macro.  (See this document's table of contents  to  see
          how the indenting works.)

          5  Helpful Hints for Using SCRMAC             _______ _____ ___ _____ ______



           1. SCRMAC  macros  may  be  used  in upper or lower case, but NO                                                                         __
              abbreviations are recognized.

           2. When omitting parameters two successive commas should be used
              for  non-trailing parameters and a right parenthesis used for
              trailing parameters.

           3. If a parameter contains  a  comma  the  parameter  should  be
              enclosed in PMF text quotes:  "<:" and ":>".

           4. The ampersand "&" is a special function character used by the
              PMF processor, and therefore  use  of  ampersands  should  be
              avoided in the text.  All underlining should be done with the
              ^u, |u pair (i.e., to underline 'string' enter '^ustring|u').
              If an ampersand is necessary in the final text it  should  be
              doubled and enclosed in PMF text quotes ( i.e., <:&&:> ).                      ___

           5. The literals "#title" and "#date" may be used anywhere in the
              document and when processed they will be  expanded  into  the
              title  and  date  parameters  of  the #document macro.  These
              literals are particularly useful as parameters to  the  title
              page macro.

           6. If  the  user  does  not  wish  to  use the title/date format
              provided by  SCRMAC  and  likes  another  format  better,  an
              explicit   Scribe   "$TITLE"   directive   should  be  placed
              immediatly  following  the  #DOCUMENT  macro  call  with  the
              prefered format.

           7. If  there  is  ever  a  need to extend a parameter list for a
              macro over more than one line, an ampersand, "&",  should  be
              used as the last character of the line to be continued.                          ____

           8. If  the  user wishes to indent lower level sections it may be
              done using the #BEGINMARGIN macro with the #SECT  macros,  or
              by  explicitly  putting the Scribe directive $POSITION at the
              beginning of the original document text.

           9. The use of SCRMAC macros in no way limits  the  user  to  use
              only  SCRMAC  emitted Scribe commands.  All Scribe directives
              may be used explicitly by the user if desired, with the  only
              exceptions being those already noted.

          10. If  there  is  a  need  to  put  a  SCRMAC  macro name into a
              document, it must be enclosed in PMF text  quotes  if  it  is
              preceded by a pound sign ('#').

          11. When  usng  QED to edit the ".PMF" file containing the macros
              it may be convienient to use the

                  BOUND /<section title>/

              command to bound your  working  area  to  one  section.  (The
              letter  case  of "#SECT" in the "SET MARK" command must match                                                                 ____
              the case in your file exactly.  It  is  recommended  that  if
              this  is used that all "#SECT" macro calls use the same case,
              either upper or lower.)

          A Sample Using SCRMAC - The Original Document          _ ______ _____ ______ _ ___ ________ ________


          #DOCUMENT(A Sample Using SCRMAC,<:August 17, 1981:>,,15)
          #TITLE_PAGE_1(#title,Part of SCRMAC User's Manual,& 
          SCRMAC Version 1.1,Responsible: Programming Languages,& 
          Prepared by: S. M. Kennedy,"<:Last Updated: #date:>)
          #FOOTNOTES(LEFT)
          #PAR_DEFAULT(,4)
          #SECT(Explaining Some SCRMAC Macros)
          In the following document I will try to explain the
          uses of some of the SCRMAC macros used when preparing 
          a document.
          The best way to use this example is to look at the text
          containing the SCRMAC macro calls while reading this
          final Scribed text.
          #PAR()
          For starters this section is a Level 1 section. The
          sections to follow (1.1 ... 1.4) are Level two sections
          and in order to get to Level 2  I must use a
          #BEGINLEVEL macro. 
          #BEGINLEVEL
          #SECT(The DOCUMENT MACRO)
          The #DOCUMENT macro is used in this document giving
          a  title and a date (enclosed in PMF text quotes,
          '<:' and ':>', because the date parameter contains
          a comma).  The third parameter is omitted and thus the
          page length will default to 66 lines. The fourth
          parameter sets the left margin to 15 spaces instead of
          the default value of 10. Since the last parameter is
          not given the right paren is used to omit trailing
          parameters and thus the page width will be set to its
          default value of 75.
          #SECT(The TITLE_PAGE_1 Macro)
          Following the #DOCUMENT  macro is the
          #TITLE_PAGE_1 macro. There are ^uonly|u two places
          this macro may be used: immediately following the
          #DOCUMENT macro, or after the #TOC macro as
          the last line of the document.
          #PAR()
          In this example I have used all six possible parameters
          to the macro to illustrate how they are all placed on
          the title page. All the parameters of this macro are
          optional and if not given will default to the null
          string - however if null, they ^uwill|u still take up
          a line on the page.
          #PAR()
          Take note of the parameter list of this macro. The
          first parameter uses the '#title' literal which
          holds the title of  the document as given to the
          #DOCUMENT macro. The last parameter uses the

          '#date' literal for the date of the document.
          If these literals are used as a parameter or part of a
          parameter to a macro the ^uvery|u first character of
          the paramater ^umust|u be a quote, '"', as done in the
          #TITLE_PAGE_1 macro. Also the parameter list for
          the macro is spread out over three lines. To do this
          an ampersand ^umust|u be the last character
          on the lines that are to be continued.
          #PAR()
          Notice in the preceding paragraphs the use of "^^u" and
          "||u" for  underlining the words "only", "will",
          "very", and "must". This method ^uis|u necessary.
          Using ampersands to ^uunderline|u will usually not work
          correctly because they are a special character used for
          other purposes by the PMF preprocessor.
          #SECT(The FOOTNOTES Macro)
          After the #TITLE_PAGE_1 macro I have used the
          #FOOTNOTES macro. This will put level one section
          titles and appendix titles as  footnotes at the bottom
          of all pages containing text for these sections.
          I have specified that I want my footnotes to be on the
          "LEFT"; they may also be "CENTER"ed or
          put on the "RIGHT".
          #PAR()
          It is recommended that if footnotes are used that level
          one sections are always started on the top of a new
          page. This will insure that the footnotes will
          correctly reflect the section on the page. If  level
          one sections are not started at the top of a new page,
          footnotes can not be guaranteed to correspond to the
          section(s) of text on the page.
          #SECT(The SECT Macro)
          The #SECT macro is used to begin sections. The
          section title is printed with the section number and
          also a table of contents entry is made for the section.
          Section numbers are handled by SCRMAC and Scribe so the
          only parameter to the #SECT macro is the title.
          Spacing around the section titles is handled by
          #SECT's current default values and may be
          controlled by the user (Section 2.).
          #PAR()
          #SECT(The PAR Macro)
          Next, notice the use of the #PAR macro. Paragraphs
          immediatly following section titles will automatically
          be indented according to the first line indentation
          default value ( I changed my default value  from zero
          to four using a DEFAULT macro - explained in
          Section 2.1 ). Paragraphs not following section titles
          may be started using the #PAR macro. The one used
          above with no parameters, #PAR(), will use the
          current default values to skip one line and indent the
          first line four spaces.

          Now I am ready to end Section One and return to Level
          one. To return to Level one I use the #ENDLEVEL
          macro. Following the end of this section I will begin a
          new Level one section, Section Two.
          #ENDLEVEL
          #SECT(Using Default And Pop Macros)
          #BEGINLEVEL
          #SECT(Default Macros)
          Default macros are used to change the current default
          values used by a macro. Initially the default values
          are set by the #DOCUMENT macro, but they may be
          changed by the user at any point in the document.
          #PAR()
          The #PAR_DEFAULT macro used in the beginning of
          this document changes the default value for the first
          line indentation of paragraphs used by the #PAR
          macro. #DOCUMENT initially sets the default values
          to skip one line before the new paragraph, and to 
          leave the first line of the paragraph without any
          indentation (indentation=0). The macro used above will
          leave the lines skipped unchanged, but changes the
          indentation to four. Now when #PAR is used with no
          parameters, #PAR(), it will be the same as using
          #PAR(1,4).
          #SECT(The Pop Macros)
          To change #PAR's default values back to their
          values before the last #PAR_DEFAULT macro call,
          the #PAR_POP macro should be used
          (^uNot|u #PAR_DEFAULT(1,0) !!). I will use the
          #PAR_POP macro after this paragraph to show the
          default values are changed back to one and zero.
          #PAR_POP
          #PAR()
          Notice that this is the beginning of the new paragraph,
          but the default indentation is changed back to zero.
          I would really like my paragraphs indented so I will
          use another #PAR_DEFAULT macro call to change the
          indentation from zero to six.
          #PAR_DEFAULT(,6)
          #ENDLEVEL
          #SECT(Figure and Margin Macros)
          The Figure and Margin macros can be very useful for
          handling certain situations encountered while preparing
          a document.
          #BEGINLEVEL
          #SECT(The Figure Macros)
          The Figure macros,#BEGINFIGURE and ENDFIGURE,
          are used in pairs around text that should be put in
          Scribe's verbatim mode (this may include a figure,
          example command lines, etc. the user does not want
          incorporated into Scribed paragraphs). To illustrate
          the use of the Figure macros here is an example:
          #BEGINFIGURE(14,,,2)

          |   the first parameter guarantees I have 14 lines |
          |   before the end of the page so my figure is not |
          |   split between pages.                           |
          |                                                  |
          |   the figure will be indented the default of     |
          |   five spaces from the left margin.              |
          |                                                  |
          |   as specified by the fourth parameter of the    |
          |   macro call, two lines will be skipped after    |
          |   the #ENDFIGURE call.                           |
          |                                                  |
          *--------------------------------------------------*
          #ENDFIGURE
          After the #ENDFIGURE call I return to the Scribe
          justification mode.
          #SECT(The Margin Macros)
          The Margin macros, #BEGINMARGIN and #ENDMARGIN,
          can be useful for indenting sections of text relative
          to the current margins. The Margin macros have been
          set up so nesting of the macros is allowed (see below
          for an example).
          #BEGINMARGIN()
          Here we have moved our margins in on both sides five
          spaces relative to the old margins (five is the
          default value).
          #BEGINMARGIN(10,0)
          Now the left margin is moved in ten more spaces, while
          the right margin is unchanged. This was done by
          specifying explicitly in the #BEGINMARGIN call
          that these indentations were wanted. Also notice a line
          is skipped after the #BEGINMARGIN call. A line will
          also be skipped after each #ENDMARGIN call (one
          skipped line is the default for both after the
          #BEGINMARGIN, and after the #ENDMARGIN).
          #ENDMARGIN
          Now we are back out to the first indentation after
          using #ENDMARGIN. I would also like to point out
          that the other macros may be used within the new
          margins.
          #PAR()
          New paragraphs may be started, and anything else that
          may normally be used with SCRMAC may be used within
          the new margins.
          #ENDMARGIN
          Now that I am back to the original margins I will end
          my discussion of the Margin macros.
          #ENDLEVEL
          #SECT(The ITEM Macros)
          In this section I would like to illustrate how the ITEM
          macros can be used to produce four types of lists by
          varying the parameters to the ITEM macros.

          #BEGINLEVEL
          #SECT(Numbered Lists)
          The first and probably most common type of list is one
          with a number associated with each item of the list:
          a numbered list. The following is a simple example of
          this type of list:
          #BEGINITEM()
          #ITEM()the first item
          #ITEM()the second item
          #ITEM()the third item
          #ITEM()this fourth item is very long to show how
          the second line of an item is handled.
          #ENDITEM
          #PAR(0)
          Notice that all the default values were used in the
          #BEGINITEM macro call. Also notice that the text of
          the items ^uimmediately|u follow the closing
          parenthesis of the #ITEM macro call. This  will
          insure that the indentation  of the item
          text is correct.
          The fourth item shows how multi-line items are indented.
          Multi-line items are handled similarly for the first three
          types of lists (Sections 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3).
          #SECT(Lists With Numbers and Labels)
          In this section I will show a list with both numbers
          and labels on items of the list. For this type of list
          the item text indentation will usually have to be
          increased to accommodate both the item number and the
          item label, and not run over into the item text area.
          #BEGINITEM(10)
          #ITEM(MDSI)Manufacturing Data Systems, Inc.
          #ITEM(ANC)Advanced Numerical Control
          #ITEM(PDT)Product Development and Technology
          #ENDITEM
          #SECT(Lists With Labels Only)
          In this example only labels will be placed before the
          item text(no  numbers). In order to do this zero must
          be specified for the  "start number" parameter in the
          #BEGINITEM macro call to turn off the numbering
          of items.
          #BEGINITEM(5,,0)
          #ITEM(I)Roman numeral one.
          #ITEM(II)Roman numeral two.
          #ITEM(III)Roman numeral three.
          #ITEM(IV)Roman numeral four.
          #ENDITEM
          #PAR(0)
          Notice that the indentaton was again increased to make
          room for the label. The default indentation is
          initially set up to accommodate a list with numbers
          only.
          #SECT(Lists With No Numbers or Labels)
          The last type of list is a special case of the ITEM

          macro. When an item does not have a number or label put
          before the item text the first line of item text is not
          indented, but any subsequent lines of text for the same
          item are indented the specified amount. Here is an
          example of this type of list:
          #BEGINITEM(10,1,0)
          #ITEM()This is the first item of the list.
          #ITEM()This is the second item of the list which should
          require more than one line thus showing how these types
          of items are indented.
          #ENDITEM
          #ENDLEVEL
          #SECT(The Table of Contents Macro)
          The last macro I would like to show you is the #TOC
          macro. It is placed  after the last line of document
          text. For every #SECT title and every #APPENDIX
          title (of which I have none in this document - see
          SCRMAC User's Manual for an example) an entry will be
          put in the table of contents along with the
          corresponding page number. Upon completion of the
          document processing, the table of contents may be then
          taken from the back of the document and placed at the
          beginning. Following this last sentence I will put in
          the #TOC macro call.
