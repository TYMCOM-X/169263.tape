#module (RUN,9/11/79)
RUN is a Pascal-callable procedure which will execute a program in a specified
file.
It corresponds to the operating system command ".RUN file".
#usage ()
external procedure run
     (  filename: packed array [1..*] of char;
        prompt: boolean );
#input (FILENAME)is the name of the file containing the program to be executed.
The filename for RUN has the same assumptions as the filename in Pascal
input/output calls, as far as defaults, format, etc.\are concerned.
#input (PROMPT)indicates whether the program is to take its input from
the terminal or from a temporary file.
If PROMPT is false, the program will be run just as if it had been executed
with a ".RUN\filename" command.
If PROMPT is true, the program will look first for a tmpcor file named "NNN";
if there is no such tmpcor file, the program will look for a disk file
named "###NNN.TMP", where ### is the current job number.
"NNN" is a three-character abbreviation of the program name; for example,
PAS for PASCAL, LNK for LINK, etc.
The documentation of any program which can use this feature should specify
just what "NNN" is for that program.
Note that when a Pascal program writes a file whose name begins with ###,
the ### will automatically be replaced with the job number.
#effects ()
The current program is terminated (closing any open files),
and the specified program is run in its place.
RUN may return to the calling program if the file name is bad, there is no
such file, etc.
All files will already have been closed in this case, however.
#algorithm ()
Uses the RUN UUO.
#notes ()
RUN closes any open Pascal files with the Pascal "CLOSE ()" call.
Thus, it will not close any non-Pascal files which may happen to be open.
