                                                                   11/01/78



     Entry: EC_DTIME     _____

     Convert a binary day/time record to an internal day/time.

     Usage:

          EXTERNAL PROCEDURE EC_DTIME(VAR ERR_CODE: DTIME_ERR;
             DTIMEBIN: DTIMEREC; VAR DTIME: DTIME_INT);

     Input arguments:

       DTIMEBIN
               a record with integer  fields  for  the  year,  month,  day,
               hours, minutes and seconds.

     Output arguments:

       ERR_CODE
               element  of  scalar type DTIME_ERR indicating whether or not
               any error  conditions  were  encountered.  An  error  return
               indicates  one  of  the  records fields had an illegal value
               (note however that Pascal's subrange  checking  will  detect
               most such errors first).

       DTIME   the internal day/time corresponding to the record (undefined
               if ERR_CODE is returned with the value DT_ERR).

     INCLUDE files required:

       DTIME.TYP
       DTIME.INC
