              1.1 Introduction to the M68000 and the runtime


                  Description:  To get a general idea of the system I will be working on I was  told
                               to  read  some  background  manuals  and  specs.  Included  were  the
                               following:

                                1.  68000 user's manual
                                2.  68000 assembly manual
                                3.  runtime conventions and standards
                                4.  portions of the runtime specification

                      I have finished the  suggested  reading,  although  I  will  have  to  re-read
                      portions  once  I  have  started  working  on projects that use the macros and
                      general runtime philosophy.

              1.2 Code and debug RTGRTIME


                  Description:  As an introduction to the runtime system, I am to  write  a  runtime
                               module  which  just  returns  a  zero.  I  will  also have to write a
                               routine in assembler that looks like a  pascal  program  to  test  it
                               since the pascal compiler for the 68000 does not work yet.

                      I have finished coding the routine, but have not as yet completed the testing.
                      I should finish on Monday.

                      I  think the routine is done, but Steve Roush is checking it over.  There will
                      probobly be at least minor changes.

                                1.  Read background information,
                                2.  Code the routines,

                      I read the i/o chapter in the MDSI pascal report, the binary i/o design notes,
                      the  Motorola  "File  Management  Services" manual, and the pascal i/o runtime
                      notes.  I have also done most of the inital coding for all  of  the  routines,
                      but  there  are probobly many problems in there.  I plan to go over my code in
                      the next week and make sure that I correctly understood the various  documents
                      on  my  first pass.  The routines should be correctly coded by the end of next
                      week.

                      This week I started working more with Bill Hope on the i/o routines.  I needed
                      to  modify  a  lot  of my code to stay consistent with what he has implemented
                      and/or planned.  I may be able to use pascal programs to do the testing.  I'll

                      find  out more about this on Monday.  I plan to start on the search and verify
                      routines next week (if that is really what I'll be working on).

                      I found out that I really can use pascal to  test  the  binary  i/o  routines.
                      Drew  Montag explained how to do this.  I did walk throughs of all my routines
                      and of Bill Hope's common i/o routines.  Bill also  read  through  all  of  my
                      routines.  I  did some initial testing with pascal which showed that there are
                      bugs (no great suprise) but started search and verify  rather  than  finishing
                      the  debugging now.  I will finish up with the debugging either late next week
                      or early the week after, depending on how long search and verify takes.

                  Progress -- 3/26/82

                      I did not work on binary i/o this week.

                  Progress -- 4/2/82

                      I restarted the testing of binary i/o this week.  Bill and I decided  to  have
                      the  BREAK and EMPTY routines completely separate for each type of file.  This
                      involved some re-writing of my code.  The cursor, extent, eof, rname,  chkval,
                      and   b.init   routines  seem  to  work.  The  write  routine  does  something
                      reasonable, but I have not carefully tested  it  as  yet.  I  need  the  close
                      routine to call B.IBREAK and the I.IEMPTY routine to exist before I can easily
                      continue testing.  This should be done by Monday.  It now  looks  like  binary
                      i/o  will  be  done  about April 9 - 13.  I don't think that there will be any
                      more redesigns.

                               These routines are documented in the runtime spec.

                      I  have  talked  to Steve Medlin about what the search and verify routines are
                      supposed to do and to Dave Wilson about the format of a set  that  I  will  be
                      looking  at.  I  have a general idea of what needs to do done.  I plan to do a
                      bit of initial coding and documentation by Monday morning and pass it by Steve
                      Medlin  to  see  if I really do have the right idea.  The routines do not look
                      very difficult.

                      The search and verify routines are written  and  seem  to  work.  Testing  the
                      routines  uncovered  some  small bugs in the pascal compiler, which have since
                      been fixed.  I spent part of this week just learning the basics of  pascal  to
                      do  the  testing.  Testing  has been done with EXE002.  I put some extra tests
                      into the program.  My version is (pasdev4)nje2.pas.  I haven't run  the  extra
                      tests as yet, but they should work.  I will finish testing on Monday.

                  Progress -- 4/2/82

                      Testing on the search and verify routines is complete.
