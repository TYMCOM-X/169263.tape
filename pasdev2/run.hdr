     PURPOSE:  RUN is a Pascal-callable procedure which will  execute
        a  program  in  a  specified  file.  It  corresponds  to  the
        operating system command ".RUN file".
     
     USAGE:
     
        external procedure run
             (  filename: packed array [1..*] of char;
                prompt: boolean );
     
     INPUT:
     
        FILENAME    is the name of the file containing the program to
                    be  executed.  The  filename for RUN has the same
                    assumptions   as   the   filename    in    Pascal
                    input/output  calls,  as far as defaults, format,
                    etc. are concerned.
     
        PROMPT      indicates whether the  program  is  to  take  its
                    input from the terminal or from a temporary file.
                    If PROMPT is false, the program will be run  just
                    as if it had been executed with a ".RUN filename"
                    command.  If PROMPT is  true,  the  program  will
                    look  first  for  a  tmpcor  file named "NNN"; if
                    there is no such tmpcor file,  the  program  will
                    look  for  a  disk file named "###NNN.TMP", where
                    ###  is  the  current  job  number.  "NNN"  is  a
                    three-character abbreviation of the program name;
                    for example, PAS for PASCAL, LNK for  LINK,  etc.
                    The  documentation  of  any program which can use
                    this feature should specify just  what  "NNN"  is
                    for   that  program.  Note  that  when  a  Pascal
                    program writes a file whose name begins with ###,
                    the  ###  will automatically be replaced with the
                    job number.
     
     EFFECTS:  The current program is terminated  (closing  any  open
        files),  and  the specified program is run in its place.  RUN
        may return to the calling program if the file  name  is  bad,
        there is no such file, etc.  All files will already have been
        closed in this case, however.
     
     ALGORITHM:  Uses the RUN UUO.
     
     NOTES:  RUN closes any open Pascal files with the Pascal  "CLOSE
        ()" call.  Thus, it will not close any non-Pascal files which
        may happen to be open.
