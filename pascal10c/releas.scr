Version 2 of MDSI Pascal is now available on account [52250,261] on ADP systems
14 and 12, along with compatible versions of the Pascal library (PASLIB),
debugger, utilities library (RDLIB), and utilities.
If no serious problems are reported with the new compiler system by Friday,
August 21, then between 4:00 pm and 6:00 pm on Friday, August 21:
$INDENT LEFT +4
$SKIP 1

\1.\Version 1U of the compiler system will be removed from account
[52250,234].

[52250,220] to account [52250,234].
$SKIP 0   $PARAGRAPH -4
\3.\Version 2 of the compiler system will be transferred from account
[52250,261] to account [52250,220].
Version 2 will also remain on account [52250,261] until Friday, August 28.
$INDENT -4
$SKIP 1
This schedule is tentative.
For updates and further details, check the message file RELEAS.NOT[52250,261].
$SKIP 1 
$NEED 2  $PARAGRAPH 5 
Version 2 of the compiler system is incompatible with version 1.
Modules compiled with the two versions cannot be linked together.
Environment files created with one version cannot be used with the other.
Programs compiled with one version cannot be loaded with the PASLIB, RDLIB,
or overlay system from the other version.
However, no source code changes are required to use the new compiler version.

$PARAGRAPH 5
The main program of the new compiler is now named PASCAL rather than NEWPAS.
The program which reads the source files for a compilation is named PASANL
rather than P10DRV or VAXDRV.
(This may require EFA file changes for anyone who is using EFA to control
access to their source files.)

$PARAGRAPH 5
The biggest change in the version 2 Pascal compiler is that it is now
compiled by itself, rather than by the "old Pascal" compiler (RND:PASCAL).

^#.\:TARGET VAX
$SKIP 1
$PARAGRAPH 5
The new compiler fully supports the :TARGET\VAX and :TARGET\P10 compiler
commands, and will generate code for both the PDP-10 and the VAX-11.
VAX code from Pascal Version 2 is compatible with the code from the VAX-only
NEWPAS Version 1C, which is on account [52250,227].
It is not compatible with code from the VAX-only NEWPAS Version 1B, which
is on account [52250,274].

$SECTION
$ENTRY '^#	/SEARCH Switch	\'
^#.\/SEARCH Switch
$SKIP 1
$PARAGRAPH 5
The compiler now supports a new command line switch, the /SEARCH switch.
The SEARCH switch provides a generalized version of the LIBRARY feature
of the SETSRC program.
It may be specified in either of the following formats:
$SKIP 1        $IND +5
$VERBATIM          
SEARCH ':' file-name-part
SEARCH '(' file-name-part [',' file-name-part]... ')'
$JUS
$IND -5
$SKIP 1 
A file-name-part is any file name, or some collection of pieces of a file name.
The following would all be legal file name parts:
$SKIP 1        $IND +5
$VERBATIM          
ALPHA.PAS
.INC
[37256,401135]
DSKB:.AVR
$JUS
$IND -5
$SKIP 1 
When the compiler fails in its attempt to open a source file (either the main
source file or an included file), it will repeat the attempt, using each
file-name-part from the SEARCH list to replace omitted pieces of the
source file name, until it succeeds in opening a source file or exhausts the
search list.
A search list file-name-part cannot replace an explicitly specified piece
of a source file name.
$SKIP 1 
$NEED 2  $PARAGRAPH 5 
For example, suppose the search list is "(.DER,[123,335],.PAR[17,77])".
Upon encountering the directive "%INCLUDE AMD", the compiler will successively
attempt to open AMD.INC in the current account, AMD.DER in  the current account,
AMD.INC[123,335], and AMD.PAR[17,777].
Upon encountering the directive "%INCLUDE VXR.INC", it will attempt to open
VXR.INC in the current account, VXR.INC in the current account (again),
VXR.INC[123,335], and VXR.INC[17,77].

$SECTION
$ENTRY '^#	Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Constants	\'
^#.\Binary, Octal, and Hexadecimal Constants
$SKIP 1
$PARAGRAPH 5
The compiler will now recognize binary, octal, and hexadecimal integer constants,
written as follows:
$SKIP 1        $IND +5
$VERBATIM          
unsigned-integer ::= binary-integer || octal-integer ||
                     decimal-integer || hexadecimal-integer

binary-integer ::= '#B' binary-digit ...
octal-integer ::= '#O' octal-digit ...
decimal-integer ::= ['#D'] decimal-digit ...
hexadecimal-integer ::= '#H' hex-digit ...

binary-digit ::= '0' || '1'
octal-digit ::= '0' || '1' || '2' || '3' ||
                '4' || '5' || '6' || '7'
decimal-digit ::= octal-digit || '8' || '9'
hex-digit ::= decimal-digit || 'A' || 'B' || 'C' || 'D' ||
                              'E' || 'F'

Example:  #B1011011 = #O133 = #D91 = 91 = #H5B
$JUS
$IND -5
$SKIP 1 
Radix codes (B, O, D, and H) and alphabetic hexadecimal "digits" (A through F)
may be in either upper or lower case.
$SKIP 1 
$NEED 2  $PARAGRAPH 5 
The old octal notation (digit\...\'B') will still be accepted, but ought to
be converted to the new notation ('#O'\digit\...).

$SKIP 2
$NEED 4
$SECTION
$ENTRY '^#	Target Machine Conditional Compilation Switches	\'
^#.\Target Machine Conditional Compilation Switches
$SKIP 1
$PARAGRAPH 5
The compiler will automatically enable a conditional compilation switch
with the same name as the target machine the code is being compiled for.
Thus, a program could contain code such as:
$SKIP 1        $IND +5
$VERBATIM          
%IF vax
   write (x:8:h);
%ENDIF
%IF p10
   write (x:6:o);
%ENDIF
$JUS
$IND -5
$SKIP 1 
which would be compiled differently, depending on whether the target machine had
been set to P10 or VAX.

word 2 of the PDP-10 stack frame.
This should result in a slight speed improvement for Pascal programs.

^#.\PDP-10 Traceback
$SKIP 1
$PARAGRAPH 5
Following a fatal error or a "control-C" interrupt in a Pascal program running
on the PDP-10, the REENTER monitor command will cause the Pascal runtime to
print a stack traceback.
It is no longer necessary to use both the REENTER and the CONTINUE commands.
In fact, if you get a stack traceback wth REENTER, a CONTINUE will then attempt
to continue the program (which is possible following a control-C interrupt or
an assertion or case index error).

Such failures should now be much less frequent.
In particular, compiler failure should no longer occur in the following cases:

The PDP-10 /NOQUICK code generator generated bad code for getstring and
putstring operations when the target string of the call (i.e., the string
in the first argument) also occurred in one of the subsequent arguments.
This has now been fixed, so that all getstring and putstring calls should
work as you would expect with all code generators.
