                      We've decided not to try using Neil Krone's simple  transfer  program  because
                      Motorola's  official  transfer  program with error checking and retransmission
                      capability is available.  This will undoubtably take longer to get up  because
                      of  its  increased  complexity  but may eliminate the need for writing our own
                      later.  The start of this task has been delayed for two reasons.  First,  Neil
                      Krone  must  obtain some missing components of the transfer program.  Second I
                      wanted to establish the initial library, with initialization  routine,  before
                      starting  on the transfer task.  The initialization routine will make creation
                      of test harnesses much easier for others working on the runtime.


                  Progress -- 1/11/82

                      Motorola's file transfer  program  works  in  "transparent"  mode  after  some
                      patches  to  the  VERSAdos operating system were applied.  The next step is to
                      get the downloading of printable ASCII files to the EXORmacs working.


                  Progress -- 1/12/82

                      Transfer of printable ASCII files is working.

                  Progress -- 1/13/82

                      Modified both ends of the transfer program  to  enable  transfer  of  VERSAdos
                      object  files  to  the  EXORmacs.  Object file transfers are now working.  The
                      remaining steps are to  get  file  transfers  working  from  TYMSHARE  and  to
                      document how to use the transfer programs.




              1.5 Exception handling macros

              1.6 Runtime Initialization Routine

                               setting  up the initial searchable object library and testing most of
                               the ideas involved in the proposed scheme  for  sharing  code  on  an
                               unmapped system.

                      I  calling  this routine done, but somewhere down the line it will undoubtably
                      have to be rewritten.  This has become apparent as we've  learned  more  about
                      the   OEM  version  of  VERSados.  However,  before  the  final  form  of  the
                      initialization routine can be determined we'll have  to  find  out  even  more
                      about OEM VERSados.  The present routine will enable work to proceed.



                  1.6.1 Versados experimentation

                                   testing it will be designed.
