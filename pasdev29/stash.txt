               STASH  is  a  program  that  facilitates  the  addition  and
          extraction  of  files  from a library.  This "packing" of several
          files into a single file saves a significant amount of disk space
          (typically  around 25%) as well as making the transportation of a
          number of separate, but related files (i.e., .TYP, .INC, or  .HDR
          files) easier.














































     File Stash Facility, Version 1.0
                                                          November 21, 1979


     1.0  The Library          ___ _______

               STASH combines separate files into segments of a single file
          called a library.  In addition to these segments, a library has a                   _______
          fixed  number  of  blocks  at  the beginning containing directory
          information about each segment.  A library, then, consists  of  a
          header  of  directory  information, and then successive segments,
          each segment corresponding to a single file.
               A "packing" effect occurs when  files  are  stored  in  this
          fashion  because  the  amount  of free space following the end of
          each segment is always less than one block (128  words).  On  the
          other  hand,  separate files may contain more than five blocks of
          free space after the end-of-file.


                LIBRARY                              "External"                _______

     File Stash Facility, Version 1.0
                                                          November 21, 1979


     2.0  Input/Output          ____________

               All file data transfers are done in  one  block  (128  word)
          increments.  Library  segment blocks consist of 127 words of data
          plus a one word checksum.  The efficiency of transferring  blocks
          of data allows STASH to add and extract files very efficiently.


     3.0  The Command Set          ___ _______ ___

               Listed  below  are  the  STASH commands and a description of
          their syntax and functions.  The  minimal  abbreviations  of  the
          commands are underlined.

     3.1  OPEN  <library name>          _

               Either  creates  a  new  library  or  prepares  a previously
          existing one for processing.  <library name>  is  simply  a  file
          name.  If  no file extension is specified, .LIB is assumed.  If a
          library is currently open, it is closed prior to opening the  new
          one.

     3.2  ADD  <filename> [,<filename>]*          _

               Adds the specified file(s) to the library as segments of the
          same name.  A <filename> is of the  form,  <name>  [.<extension>]
          [ '['<ppn>']' ].   If   a   segment   of   the   same  file  name
          (disregarding <ppn>) already exists  in  the  library,  then  the
          existing entry is deleted.

     3.3  EXTRACT  <segment name> [,<segment name>]*          _

               Copies  the  specified  library segment(s) into files of the
          same name.  Wildcarding with '*' or '?' may be used to specifying
          several segments at a time.

     3.4  DELETE  <segment name> [,<segment name>]*          _

               Deletes  the  specified segments from the library directory.
          This does not actually remove the segment*, it simply marks it as                                 ______
          being not in use.  Wildcarding ('*', '?') may be used in the name
          specifications.

     3.5  DIR  [ <segment name>[,<segment name>]* ]          ___

               Lists directory information about the size,  creation  date,
          and  access date for each of the specified segments.  Wildcarding
          may be used.  If no segment name is specified,  then  information
          about all of the segments in the library is listed.






     *See PACK, section 3.6.
                                                                     Page 3

     3.6  PACK          ____

               "Squeezes"  out the space left by previously deleted library
          segments.

     3.7  HELP  [ <command> ]          ____

               Lists helpful information about the specified  command.  The
          command  may  be  any of the ones enumerated in sections 3.1-3.8.
          If no command is specified, then information  about  all  of  the
          commands is listed.

     3.8  QUIT          _

               Closes the library and exits.

     4.0  STASH Interfaces          _____ __________

               In  addition  to  the  STASH  program, there are available a
          number of modules with routines that facilitate the management of
          a   library.   The   file   LIB.TYP  contains  all  of  the  type
          declarations needed  for  the  interfaces  to  STASH.  The  type,
          LIBRARY,  is  the main library record.  It contains the I/O file,
          buffers, and other utility variables that allow the interfaces to
          operate properly on the library.
               Other types of interest are:



          NAME_TYPE = RECORD
            NAME : PACKED ARRAY[1..6] OF CHAR;
            EXT  : PACKED ARRAY[1..3] OF CHAR;
          END;

          WORD = -377777777777B..377777777777B;

          DIRECTORY_ENTRY = RECORD
            SEG_NAME : NAME_TYPE;             (* the segment name *)
            LENGTH : 0..MAXIMUM(WORD);        (* char length of seg *)
            WRITE_DATE,                       (* creation date *)
            ACCESS_DATE : DTIME_INT;          (* last access date *)
            IN_USE : BOOLEAN                  (* false if deleted *)
          END;



               Note  that these interfaces must be used with the new Pascal                                                                 ___

          PUBLIC PROCEDURE OPN_SEGMENT ( VAR F : LIBRARY;
                                         SEG_NAME : NAME_TYPE;
                                         VAR ERR : ERRCODE );

               This  procedure  creates a new directory entry for the given
          segment name, and prepares the library for the addition of a  new
          segment.  Only  one  segment  may  be  open for output at a time.                          ___
          Therefore, if a segment was already open at the time of the call,
          it  is  closed prior to opening the new one.  Subsequent calls to
          module SEGOUT routines will add to this new segment.

          Input          _____

            SEG_NAME
                    is the name of the segment for which the new  directory
                    entry is to be created and written.

          Output          ______

            ERR     is  a STASH error code.  An error occurs if the library

     4.4  Module SEGIN          ______ _____

               This module handles the reading of library segments into the
          calling program's variables.  Library segments  can  be  read  as
          words  (36-bit  integers),  characters, or lines, and the user is
          advised against mixing these input modes.  Any number of segments
          may  be  read, since segments do not need to be opened for input.
          To specify the segment to read from, one obtains the  DIR_IDX  of
          the  segment to read, usually from procedure FIND_DIR, and passes
          it to the appropriate segin procedure.

     4.4.1  RD_WORD            _______

          PUBLIC PROCEDURE RD_WORD ( VAR F : LIBRARY;

                                     VAR ERR : ERRCODE );

               This procedure fills an array with words  from  a  specified
          segment and location.

          Input          _____

            DIR_INDEX
                    is  the  index of the directory entry of the segment to
                    read.

            INDEX   is the index of the start  of  the  read.  The  segment
                    read  begins from the INDEXed word in the segment.  The
                    index of the first word in a segment is 1.

            NUM_TO_READ
                    is the number of words to read from  the  segment  into
                    the array.

          Output          ______

            WORDS_LEFT
                    is  defined  as NUM_TO_READ - (number of words actually
                    read).  The number of words actually read may  be  less
                    than   NUM_TO_READ   if  the  end  of  the  segment                     encountered, or if an error occurs.  Normally, however,
                    this is 0.

            WORD_ARRAY
                    is the array to be filled with the read words.

            ERR     is a STASH error code.  An error occurs if the INDEX is
                    greater than the segment's length (INTR_FATAL),  or  if
                    the library is not open (LIB_IOFATAL).


                                                                    Page 10

               This  procedure  fills  an  array  with  characters  from  a
          specified segment and location.

          Input          _____

            DIR_INDEX
                    is the index of the directory entry of the  segment  to
                    read.

            INDEX   is  the  index  of  the start of the read.  The segment
                    read begins from the INDEXed character in the  segment.
                    The index of the first character in the segment is 1.

            NUM_TO_READ
                    is  the  number  of characters to read from the segment
                    into the array.

          Output          ______

            CHARS_LEFT
                    is defined  as  NUM_TO_READ  -  (number  of  characters
                    actually read).  The number of characters actually read
                    may be less than NUM_TO_READ if the end of the  segment
                    is  encountered,  or  if  an  error  occurs.  Normally,
                    however, this is 0.

            CHAR_ARRAY
                    is the array to be filled with the read characters.

            ERR     is a STASH error code.  An error occurs if the INDEX is

     5.0  Library Integrity          _______ _________

               All I/O operations on the library file are done  in  such  a
          way  that  at any point in time the directory accurately reflects
          the actual contents of the library segments.  If for  any  reason
          STASH  should  be  interrupted (attention, system failure, etc.),
          the information contained in the  directory  would  still  be  an
          accurate  reflection  of  the  library.  If  such an interruption
          should occur during a write operation to a segment, then at  most
          one  block (the current I/O buffer) would be lost.  The directory
          would still be good in this situation.
               Library packing is done by writing the packed version of the
          library  to  a  backup  file,  and  then  when  the  operation is
          complete, renaming files.
               The library segments are checksummed, and tampering  with  a                                    ___
          library  file with any routines other than the STASH routines can
          irreversibly damage the library's contents.
