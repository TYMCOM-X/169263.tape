                                                                   10/30/78



     Entry: DIR_MATCH     _____

     This routine matches a string to a wild card pattern,  returning  true
     if the string matches the pattern.

     Usage:

          external function DIR_MATCH
            ( FNAME: DIR_FNAME;
              PATTERN: DIR_M_STR ) : boolean;

     Input arguments:

       FNAME   is the string to match.

       PATTERN is the pattern to which to match the string FNAME.

     Output arguments:

       <Function value>
               is set TRUE if FNAME matches PATTERN, FALSE otherwise.

     Requirements:

       none.

     Notes:

       The  characters  "*" and "?" are wild card characters, and cannot be
       matched literally.  Asterisk matches any string, including the  null
       string.  Question  mark  matches  any  single character, or the null
       string.  For example, a string of five question  marks  matches  any
       string  of  length  less than or equal to five.  A wild field within
       the pattern containing an asterisk is effectively  replaced  with  a
       single  asterisk,  i.e. the  pattern  "Q??*"  is  equivalent  to the
       pattern "Q*".

       The null pattern matches only the null string; the  null  string  is
       matched by a pattern containing only wild card characters, or by the
       null pattern.
