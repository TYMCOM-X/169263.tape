              1.1 Intro to the M68000 and RDLIB


                  Description: At the present I can not put much detail into my schedule as  to  the
                               specific  tasks I will have.  For the near future the following items
                               are topics in which I will be involved:

                                1. Learning about the current RDLIB routines on both the  DEC10  and
                                   the VAX;
                                2. Finding out which RDLIB routines ANC uses;
                                3. Learning the M68000 Assembler;
                                4. Studying the relevant M68000 Spec documents;
                                5. Determining  a  priority  (or  order)  for  working  on the RDLIB
                                   routines that  will  be  needed,  and  expand  this  schedule  in
                                   accordance with the determined order.


                                 Start       Completion                               __________    __________

                  Scheduled:     11/30/81    1/4/82

                  Actual:        11/30/81    1/4/82


                  Progress -- 1/4/82


                       1. The available documentation on RDLIB has been read.









          M680000 Project - SMK                                                              Page 2
          February 3, 1982


                       2. It  will most likely be more efficient for us to come up with our own list
                          of routines we know ANC uses and present this list to ANC for  review  and
                          modification.  There  are  some  (perhaps many) items that will have to be
                          discussed with ANC to determine what they "need" and what will be possible
                          to provide.

                       3. I  have  read  and  gone over both the M68000 16-Bit Microprocessor User's
                          Manual and the Resident Structured Assembler Reference Manual.

                       4. I have read the M68000 design documents that  have  been  distributed  and
                          have a general understanding of them.

                       5. Once  we  come  up with our list of RDLIB routines for ANC a more specific
                          schedule for studying, coding, implementing, and  testing  these  routines
                          will be determined.





              1.2 RDLIB Development Procedure


                  Description: I  plan  to  draw  up a procedure that will be used in investigating,
                               documenting (for both the M68000 RDLIB User Documentation and Program
                               Notebook  Documentation),  coding,  and  testing  of individual RDLIB
                               routines.  This is being done so that a standard procedure exists  in
                               the  development  process,  with the goals being consistancy in RDLIB
                               development.

                  Progress -- 1/5/82

                      The procedure has  been  put  together  and  SCRMAC  input  can  be  found  in
                      (PASDEV32)M68PRO.PMF.  A copy will be given to SMR and PJP.




              1.3 Outline RDLIB


                  Description: This  task  will  involve putting together a document which lists the
                               RDLIB  routines  to  be  implemented  on  the  M68000,  and  a  brief
                               description  of each routine.  Included in the description will be an
                               indication of the language that was used to  code  the  corresponding
                               routine  on  the VAX, whether the routine is system dependent, and if
                               the routine can be coded as previously speced, or if some part of the
                               spec needs to be defined.  Also included in the same document will be
                               a list of issues that will have to be discussed with ANC to determine
                               their  needs, and determine whether we can meet those needs directly,
                               through some viable alternative, or not at all.

                                 Start       Completion                               __________    __________

                      I was absent from work due to  illness  and  severe  weather  conditions  from
                      1/6 thru 1/11, as a result this task was rescheduled as shown above.

                  Progress -- 1/14/82

                      The  document  has been completed and a copy was given to SMR and PJP.  SCRMAC
                      input can be found in (PASDEV32)M68DOC.PMF.




              1.4 Standard Macros


                  Description: Macros used in assembly coding are needed to insure that the standard
                               sequences  as  described  in  the Runtime Specification are followed.
                               This will also make it convenient if  for  some  reason  any  of  the
                               standard sequences have to be changed.

                      The  macros  to  be  used in the assembly language coding of RDLIB subroutines
                      have been written and put in  the  file  1002..RDLIBMAC.SA.  The  actual  work
                      involved  was  less  than  originally  expected (accounting for being ahead of
                      schedule).  Once I understood how the the entry and exit sequences are handled
                      by  the  compiler  the writting of the macros was rather easy.  Also, I waited
                      until all the macros were written before I entered  the  code,  thus  all  the
                      sub-tasks below were completed on the same day.  (Friday 1/22/82).

                  Progress -- 1/27/82

                      A  number  of bugs were found in the macros once we started assembling - those
                      bugs have been fixed.  In addition, I have added  a  number  of  other  macros
                      besides  the  three  macros  listed  below.  Added  to  the macro file are the
                      following new macros:

                       1. RD$ADD_BLANK  this macro is used by RD$PGM_BLK to pad the end of filenames
                                   less than six characters out to six characters.

                       2. RD$PGM_BLK  this macro sets up the program block for the module (file).

                       3. RD$MODULE   this macro sets up the beginning of the module with a standard
                                   sequence of assembler directives and also sets up some convenient
                                   symbols.

              1.5 Scheduling RDLIB Development


                  Description: A schedule for the writing of the RDLIB routines will be  formed  and
                               documented.  This  document will also include areas where 1) problems
                               may exist that could lead to schedule extentions, 2) investigation is

                               needed,  or  3) consultation  is needed.  The schedule document, upon
                               completion, will be translated to put in this schedule.

                      This task has been abandoned because it is  felt  that  the  documentation  of
                      RDLIB  subroutine development can be sufficiently done in the schedule itself.
                      The scheduling of RDLIB development will begin in the next task section.




              1.6 RDLIB Subroutine Development

                               subroutines  in  the  RDLIB Package.  The development of each routine
                               will be done as outlined in (PASDEV32)M68PRO.TXT.  Only a portion  of
                               the  RDLIB  routines  will be scheduled at first and the rest will be
                               scheduled as the library is built.

                      K. Palgut and I met today to talk about RDLIB.  Items discussed were:

                       1. Header for the RDLIB Assembly source code.  [KMP]
                       2. M68000 RDLIB Documentation
                            a. User Documentation.
                            b. Macros to be used in doing User Documentation.  [SMK]
                            c. Program Notebook Documentation.
                       3. Dividing up the responsibilities of RDLIB Delelopment

                      My part of RDLIB will be documented as we divide up the routines for RDLIB.



                  1.6.1 RDLIB User Documentation


                      Description: Documentation of RDLIB will be a continuous task and will be done
                                   as  routines  are  implemented.  Before  any documentation can be
                                   done there are three sub-tasks that need to  be  completed;  they

                                       in  a  standard  format.  To aid in adhering to this standard
                                       format I will write a set of PMF macros that will  correspond
                                       to  the  standard  items  found in a routine's documentation.
                                       These macros will include:

                                       #ENTRY  gives entry point name;

                                      This tast will entail more work  than  originally  thought.  I
                                      will  have to put together a BNF representation for the M68000
                                      file  formats.  This  BNF  representation  will  then  be  run
                                      through  LEXGEN  to produce a table used by CMD_FILE_NAME (and
                                      also FILUTL routines).

                                      This task will involve much more work  than  even  thought  on
                                      2/9/82.  After  looking  into  setting up a BNF representation
                                      for  the  Motorola,  we  have  found  a  way  to  set  up  the
                                      CMD_FILE_NAME  (and  PR_FILE_ID)  routine  so  that  only  the
                                      include files for  the  routines  will  be  system  dependent.
                                      Presently  all  systems have their own pascal source files for
                                      CMD_FILE_NAME and PR_FILE_ID.  The plan now  is  to  make  one
                                      system  independent  pascal source file for the above routines
                                      and have system dependent include files for each system.

                                      Pascal source files for CMD_FILE_NAME and PR_FILE_ID have been
                                      set  up  and  are  on  PASDEV2.  Four system dependent include
                                      files have been put on the system accounts:  TYMSHARE-PASDEV2,
                                      ADP-PASCAL10C,   VAX-PASDEV3,   and  M68-PASDEV4.  CMDUTL  and
                                      FILUTL routines both compile for their specific  all  systems.
                                      We  have  found  out  from ANC that these routines will not be
                                      needed for their benchmarks, and therefore  testing  of  these
                                      routines  will  be  postponed  until after the PASDIR routines
                                      have been completed (PASDIR routines will be needed  in  ANC's
                                      benchmarks).
