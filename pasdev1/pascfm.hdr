     PURPOSE:  This is the command line manager module, which is used
        by  NEWPAS to manipulate an internal list of pending commands
        from auto-startup and indirect command files.
     
     ENTRY POINTS:
     
        cmd_name_stack
                    is the stack of  file  names  of  active  command
                    files.
     
        cmd_list    is  the  list of pending command lines which have
                    been read from command files.
     
        last_cmd    is a pointer to the eof  entry  for  the  current
                    file in the pending command list.
     
        rd_cmd_file copies  lines  from  a  specified  file  into the
                    pending command list, and pushes the command file
                    name on the command file name stack.
     
        rd_tmpcor   copies  lines  from a buffer containing text read
                    from a tmpcor file, and pushes the tmpcor name on
                    the command file name stack.
     
        cmd_save    writes  the command list and file name stack to a
                    specified file.
     
        cmd_load    reads the command list and file name  stack  back
                    in from a specified file.
     
        cmd_clear   disposes of the command list and file name stack.
