Abstract
--------


The document describes a series of test programs written in Pascal.  Th
suite of programs may be used to validate a Pascal processor by
presenting it with a series of programs which it should, or should not,
accept.  The suite also contains a number of programs that explore
implementation-defined features and the quality of the processor.  The
tests are generally based on the draft ISO Standard for Pascal.








Not for publication

This is a working document.  It is being continually revised and
extended.  Comments, corrections, extra tests, and results of running
any tests would be most welcome.

1.  INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE
----------------------------

This paper describes a suite of test programs which has been designed
to support the draft Standard (Addyman, 1979) for the programming
language Pascal (Jensen & Wirth, 1975) prepared for approval by ISO.
(In the rest of this paper, the draft Standard is simply referred to
as the Standard).  It therefore follows similar work done by AFSC(1970)
for COBOL, and Wichmann (1973,76,77) for Algol 60.


The suite of programs is called a validation suite for Pascal
processors; however it is important to emphasize that no amount of
testing can assure that a processor that passes all tests is error-free
Inherent in each test are some assumptions about possible processors an
their designs; a processor which violates an assumption may apparently
pass the test without doing so in reality.  Also, some violations may
simply not be tested because they never occurred to the validation
suite designers, nor were generated from the draft Standard.


Two examples may illustrate this as a warning to users against expectin
too much.  Firstly, consider a fully interpretable Pascal processor.  I
may pass a test which contains a declaration which it would mis-handle
otherwise, simply because the program did not include an access to the
object concerned so that it was never interpreted.  A second example
might be a Pascal processor which employs a transformation of the Pasca
syntax rules.  Since the pathological cases incorporated into the test
programs are based on the original rules, a mistake in transformation
may not be detected by the test programs.


On the other hand, the test series contains a large number of test
cases which exercise a Pascal processor fairly thoroughtly.  Hence
passing the tests is a strong indication that the processor is well-
designed and unlikely to give trouble in use.  The validation suite
may therefore be of interest to two main groups:  implementors of
Pascal, and users of Pascal.


Implementors of Pascal may use the test series to assist them in
producting an error_free processor.  The large number of tests, and
their independent origin, will assist in detecting many probable
implementation errors.	The series may also be of use for re-validation
of a processor after modification to incorporate a new feature, or
to fix an error.




Users of Pascal, which includes actual programming users, users of
Pascal-written software, prospective purchasers of Pascal processors,
and many others, will also be interested in the validation suite.
For them it will provide an opportunity to measure the quality of an
implementation, and to bring pressure on implementors to provide a
correct implementation of Standard Pascal.  In turn, this will improve
the portability of Pascal programs.  To emphasize this role, the
validation suite also contains some programs which explore features
which are permitted to be implementations defined, and some tests
which seek to make quality judgements on the processor.  The validation
suite is therefore an important weapon for users to use in
influencing suppliers.


Naturally, implementors of Pascal are best placed to understand why
a processor fails a particular test, and how to remedy the fault.
However, the users' view of a Pascal processor is mainly at the Pascal
language level, and the fact of a failure is sufficient for the
users' purpose.




2.  THE TEST PROGRAM STRUCTURE
------------------------------


Each test program follows a consistent structure to aid users of the
suite in handling them.  Most of the following rules apply to all
programs: a few hold everywhere except in a few test cases meant to
test the particular feature involved.  Such rules are marked by an
asterisk, and a following note points out the exceptions.


    (i)   Each program starts with a header comment, whose structure is
	  given later.
    (ii)  The header comment is always immediately followed by an
	  explanatory comment in plain English, which describes the
	  test to be carried out and its probable results.
    (iii) Each program closes with the characters "end." in the first
	  four character positions of a line.  This pattern does not
	  otherwise occur in the program text.
    (iv)  All program lines are limited to 72 character positions.
    (v)*  The lexical tokens used are in conformance with the
	  conventions set out in the draft ISO standard, and
	  reproduced in an appendix.  Thus comments are enclosed in
	  curly brackets, the not-equal token is "<>", etc.  In
	  addition, all program text is in lower case letters, with
	  mixed-case used in comments in accordance with normal
	  English usage.  String- and character-constants are always
	  given in upper-case letters.	(Note:	A few tests set out
	  to check lexical handling, and may violate these rules.
	  Translation of mixed cases to one case will therefore make
	  these tests irrevlevant, but will have no other effect.)
    (vi)  Direct textual replacement of any lexical token, or the
	  comment markers with the approved equivalents given in the
	  Standard, will not cause the significant text on a program
	  line to exceed 72 characters.
   (viii)*The program writes to the default file output, which is
	  therefore declared in the program heading.  (Note: one
	  test - the minimal program - does no printing; a few
	  cross-references are virtually the same.).




2.1  The header comment
-----------------------


The header comment always begins with the characters "{TEST" in
positions 1-5 of a line.  No other comments are permitted to have the
character "{" and "T" directly juxtaposed in this way.	The syntax
of a header comment in EBNF is given by:


header-comment = "{TEST"program-number "," "CLASS=" category_name"}" .


program_number = number {"." number} "-" number .


number	       = digit {digit} .


category-name  = CONFORMANCE ! DEVIANCE ! IMPLEMENTATIONDEFINED !
		 ERRORHANDLING ! QUALITY ! EXTENSION .


For example, a possible header comment is:
     {TEST 6.5.3-10, CLASS=CONFORMANCE}


The program number identifies a section in the standard which gives
rise to the test, and a serial number following the dash to
uniquely identify each test within that section.  If other sections
of the Standard are relevant, the explanatory comment will mention
them.  The program title is constructed from the section number by
replacing "TEST" by "t", "." by "p" for point, and "-" by "d" for
dash.  Thus the above header comment belongs to a program t6p5p3d10.
This technique may also be used to make the program source test file
in processing.


The category-name identifies a class into which this test falls.
The function and design of each test depends on its class.  These
are explained later.  Thus it is possible to read through the
validation suite file and simply identify the header comment by the
leading "{T" in the first two character positions, identify its
section relevance and construct a unique identifier for each program,
and to select programs of particular classes.




2.2  The program classes
------------------------

2.2.1 Class = CONFORMANCE
-------------------------
      -------------------

The simplest category to explain is CLASS=CONFORMANCE. These programs
are always correct standard Pascal, and should compile and execute.
With one exception (the minimal program), the program should
print "PASS" and the test number if the program behaves as expected.
In some cases an erroneous interpretation causes the program to
print "FAIL"; in other cases it may fail before doing this (in
execution, loading or compilation). Conformance tests are derived
directly from the requirements of the Standard, and attempt
to ensure that processors do indeed provide the features that the
Standard says are part of Pascal, and that they behave as defined.
Since  conforming programs execute to completion, typical conformance
tests will include a number of related features; all will
be exercised by processors that pass.

2.2.2 Class = DEVIANCE
----------------------
      ----------------

The next simplest category to explain is CLASS=DEVIANCE.  These
programs are never standard Pascal, but differ from it in some
subtle way.  They serve to detect processors that meet one or more
of the following criteria:
     (a)  the processor handles an extension of Pascal,
     (b)  the processor fails to check or limit some Pascal feature
	  appropriately, or
     (c)  the processor incorporates some common error.
Ideally, a processor should report clearly on all deviance tests that
they are extensions, or programming errors.  This report should be
at compile-time if possible, or in some cases in execution.  A
processor does not conform to the standard if it executes to
completion.  In such cases the program will print a message beginning
"DEVIATES", and users of the tests must distinguish between
extensions and errors.	(In a few cases a possible extension is tested
also for consistency under this class.)


It is obviously not possible to test all possible errors or extensions.
The deviance tests are therefore generated from some assumptions about
implementation (which may differ from test to test), and from experienc
with past flaws detected.  No attempt is made to detect extensions base
on new statement types or procedures, but attention is concentrated
on more stable areas.  Obviously since each deviance test is oriented t
one feature, they tend to be shorter than conformance tests, and to
generate a short series where one conformance test collects several
examples.




2.2.3. Class = IMPLEMENTATIONDEFINED
------------------------------------
       -----------------------------

In some sections of the Standard, implementors are permitted to
exercise some freedom in implementing a feature.  An example is the
significance limit of identifiers; another is the evaluation order
of boolean expressions.  The CLASS=IMPLEMENTATIONDEFINED tests are
designed to report on the handling of such features.  A processor
may fail these tests by not handling them correctly, but generally
should execute and print some message detailing the implementation
dependency.  The collection of such implementation dependencies is
useful to the writers of portable software.  Some tests in this
category require care in interpretation, as the messages generated
by the test program rely on some assumptions about the processor
implementation.  The programs may or may not be standard Pascal:  often
they are not.


For example, one program attempts to measure the significance limits
of identifiers by declaring a series of differing length in an
inner procedure that are different from an outer series by their last
letter.  Thus it violates the requirement for uniqueness over the
first eight characters and relies on masquerading redefinition under
the scope rules for its effect.  One processor, however, reports that
just this is happening during compilation.  Though this is ideal
behaviour, it would destroy the test if the program then was not
permitted to run.  (In this case, in fact, the messages were only
warnings.)


2.2.4.	Class = ERRORHANDLING
-----------------------------
	---------------------

The Standard specifies a number of situations by stating that
"an error occurs if" the situation occurs.  The tests of this class
each evoke one (and only one) such error.  They are therefore not
in Standard Pascal with respect to this feature, but otherwise
conform.

A correct processor will detect each error, most probably as it occurs
during execution but possibly at an earlier time, and would give
some explicit indication of the error to the user.  Processors that
fail to detect the error will exhibit some undefined behaviour:  the
tests enable these cases to be identified, and allows for documentation
of the handling of detected errors.


2.2.5.	Class = QUALITY
-----------------------
	---------------

These tests are a miscellany of test programs which have as their
only common feature that they explore in some sense the quality of
an implementation.  The tests include the following, amongst others:

     *	  tests that can be timed, or used to estimate the
	  performance.
     *	  tests that have known syntax errors which can be
	  used to inspect the diagnostics.
     *	  tests that establish whether the implementation
	  has a limit which is a virtual infinity in some
	  list or recursive production.  For example a deep
	  nesting of for-loops (but not unreasonable!) would
	  see whether there was any limit, perhaps due to a
	  shortage of registers on a computer.


2.2.6.	Class = EXTENSION
-------------------------
	-----------------

A final category is CLASS=EXTENSION.  These are specific to some
conventionalized extension approved by the Pascal Users Group, such
as the provision of an otherwise clause in case statements.  In this
case, the class in the header comment is followed by a sub-class, as
in the example:
     {TEST 6.8.-1, CLASS=EXTENSION, SUBCLASS=CONFORMANCE}
The subclass gives the purpose of the test according to the previously
explained classes.


3.  STRUCTURE OF THE VALIDATION SUITE
-------------------------------------

The validation suite as distributed consists of:


A.  Machine-readable files
    ----------------------

    1.	A header file containing the character set and an explanation
	of the structure of the other files.
    2.	A skeleton program, written in Pascal, to operate on the
	previous file.
    3.	A copy of this report.
    4.	A file consisting of the sequence of test programs arranged
	in lexicographic order of their program-number (see section 2.1

B.  Printed materials
    -----------------

    1.	This document.
    2.	A printed version of A.1.


The skeleton program as supplied prints the test programs on the
output file, but calls a procedure newprogram before listing the
start of a program, and calls a procedure endprogram after printing
the last end of a program.  These procedures as now supplied
simply print a heading and a separator respectively.  However,
users of the suite may write versions of newprogram and endprogram
that may write programs to different named files, and which may
initiate jobs in the operating system queues to carry out the tests.
The two procedures newsuite and endsuite are also provided in case
these are of use.


Since newprogram may return a status result, it may also be
programmed to be selective in its handling of tests.  Only
conformance tests may be selected, or only tests in section 6.3, as
required.


The skeleton program is in standard Pascal, and conforms to the
conventions of the validation suite (but has no header comment).  It is
documented in an Appendix.




4.  REPORTING THE RESULTS
-------------------------


The results of a pass of the validation suite against a Pascal
processor should be reported in a standard way, illustrated by the

5.  ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
--------------------


The authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of many colleagues
who have collected difficult cases and bugs in their compilers
and have passed them on for inspirational purposes.  Many of the
tests have been derived from work of B.A. Wichmann (1973) and
A.H.J. Sale (1978) and significant contributions have also been
made by A.M. Addyman and R.D. Tennent.	N. Saville and R. Freak
contributed greatly by bringing consistency and care into the
large effort required to assemble the validation suite itself.


The present level of the suite would not have been possible without
the work of BSI DPS/13/4 in drawing up the draft ISO Standard,
nor without the support of the Pascal Users Group.

Appendix : Documentation of Skeleton Program
--------------------------------------------


Purpose
-------
The skeleton program provided gives a correct standard Pascal
program that will identify each test in a file of test programs.  It
is distributed with five stubs which are intended for user
modification so that the program will serve as the parent of an
automatic system for running the tests,  With the large number
of tests in the validation suite, such a system is important.
As distributed the stubs simply print the test of the test program.


Implementation
--------------
If the recipient's Pascal processor will accept upper- and lower-case
letters, and the ISO standard lexical representation, then the
program should be able to run directly.  If lexical substitutions
are necessary, these should be made.  No lines approach the limiting
length of 72 closely, so some expansion room is possible.  If only
one case of letters is available for the source text, then the whole
program should be upper-cased with the exception of the character
constants in the main program and the procedure convert.  If
however, the Pascal processor is also limited to upper-case
characters in the char type, these too will have to be converted,
and the whole of the validation suite will have to be converted
to upper-case alone before the program will run.


Modification
------------
Once the recipient has verified that he has the skeleton working
correctly, it can be modified to other purposes,  If the only use
desired is the construction of many  individual files, each with
a single test program, then newsuite and endsuite may be made dummy
procedures.  Procedure newprogram can open (rewrite) a file with the
converted name supplied, which is guaranteed unique, leaving
processline to write the text to this file and endprogram to do
any necessary closing of the file.
Alternatively, the program may be modified to construct a job
deck including job control statements.	The newprogram procedure will
have some more complex actions to take, and the endprogram
procedure will initiate the job into the operating system queues.
In the event that the user wants to batch up the tests in
lots of 20 or so, the access to the variable count allows newprogram
and endprogram to take appropriate action every twentieth test.  Or
again, if the whole lot is to be batched or submitted as a simulated
time-sharing job, the newsuite and endsuite programs can be used to
initialize and initiate.

Additionally the newprogram procedure is given access to the test
program name and its class.  Specially tailored programs can be written
to only initiate conformance tests, or only conformance tests
relevant to section 6.5 of the Standard, or whatever the user desires.
If necessary, specifications could be read in, most easily by a
modified version of the newsuite procedure.


System documentation
--------------------
The main program alternates between dormant states where it searches
for the header comment starting a test, and active states where it
processes lines keeping an eye out for the closing end of the test.
When it finds a header comment, it extracts the data for passing to
the stub procedures newprogram and endprogram.

The procedure extract does this extraction from the line buffer.  It
essentially assumes correctness of the header syntax.  The program
name is stored in a special record.

The procedure convert is not necessary to the distributed version
apart from a demonstrative use.  It is provided to convert test
program numbers from numeric format (e.g. 6.2.8-4) to an alphabetic
format suitable as an identifier or file name (e.g. t6p2p8d4).	It
switches the format in the name record from whatever it is to the
alternative format.  The format as supplied to newprogram is
digitized.

The procedure readaline does simply that.  The line is stored in an
internal buffer line.

The procedures newprogram and endprogram have value parameters with
exactly the same name as their global counterparts.  This is to
hide the global variables from them and provide some measure of
robustness against errors.  The status parameter of newprogram is
listed explicitly to emphasize the possible change of value.

There are features of Pascal in the program that may not be implemented
There are two goto statements leading to a disaster-exit label; if
non-local gotos are not implemented the gotos may be omitted or
replaced by a halt equivalent.	The packing in charvectype is only
provided to allow comparisons with character array constants
("strings").  All identifiers have been checked for uniqueness
over the first eight characters, and no non-standard usages have
been detected in the program.  If it is necessary to alter the program
to recognize header comments by '(*T' instead of '{T', some changes
will be necessary on two lines of the main program.


Lexical structure of procedures

	extract
	   scan
	newsuite*

Distributed version
-------------------
As distributed the skeleton program prints all the test programs,
one per page, in sequence.  The headings simply illustrate some
features of the package.  Warning: this takes a lot of paper, so
be prepared.
