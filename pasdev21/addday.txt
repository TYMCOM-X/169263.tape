     Add a given number of days to an internal day/time.

     Usage:

             NUM_DAYS: DAYS): DTIME_INT;

     Input arguments:

       DTIME   a day/time in internal form.

       NUM_DAYS
               a (possibly negative) number of days.

     Output arguments:

       <return value>
               an internal day/time formed by adding the  specified  number
               of days to the given day/time.  If a negative day/time would
               result then the internal day/time for day zero is returned.
