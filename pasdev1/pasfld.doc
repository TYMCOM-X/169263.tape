#system (Pascal Compiler)
#module (PASFLD,11/7/78)
This module contains the constant expression folding module.
Actually, two distinct modules are compiled from PASFLD.
If $X1 is enabled, then PA1FLD is generated.
The version of FOLD in this module is recursive, and will fold all the
operands of an expression before attempting to fold the expression itself.
If $X2 is enabled, the PA2FLD is generated.
This version of FOLD is non-recursive.
It assumes that the operands of an expression will already have been folded
when FOLD is called.
#entry (fold)&
takes an expression tree, applies any applicable constant folding operations
to it, and returns the folded expression tree.
The pass 1 version of Fold also takes the parse tree for the expression, and
the pass 2 version takes the source id of the statement containing the
expression.
If an error is detected in an expression being folded, a warning message
is printed on the indicated parse node or line, and the expression is not
folded.
Only a warning message is printed because there is the possibility that the
expression will not be evaluated at run time, so an actual error may not
occur.
