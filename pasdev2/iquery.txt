     Entry: I_QUERY     _____

     This routine will print a question  on  the  terminal,  get  a  yes/no
     answer  from the user, and return true or false, respectively.  If the
     user answers anything other than YES or NO, it will  print  a  further
     elaboration of the question.

     Usage:

          EXTERNAL FUNCTION I_QUERY
                ( QUESTION: PACKED ARRAY [1..*] OF CHAR;
                  ELABORATION: PACKED ARRAY [1..*] OF CHAR ): BOOLEAN;

     Input arguments:

       QUESTION
               is  any  string of characters.  It will be typed verbatim on
               the user's terminal, leaving the terminal cursor at the  end
               of the question string.

       ELABORATION
               is any string of characters.  If the user types a non-empty,
               invalid response to the question, then this string  will  be
               printed.  If  the  ELABORATION string is to be more than one
               line long, then the carriage return and line  feed  must  be
               included  in  it  explicitly.  If  the ELABORATION string is
               null, then the QUESTION string will simply be  retyped  when
               elaboration is requested.

     Output arguments:

       <return value>
               will  be  TRUE  if  the  user  types  YES in response to the
               question, and FALSE if the user types NO.

     Algorithm:

       [1] Type the QUESTION on the terminal, and read the response.

       [2] If the response is YES, YE, or Y, return TRUE.  If the  response
       is NO or N, return FALSE.  If the response is null or ELABORATION is
       null, go back to [1].

       [3] Type the ELABORATION on the terminal, read the response, and  go
       back to [2].
