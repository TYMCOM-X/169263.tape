      SYSTEM:  FILUTL subroutines
      
      STARTED:  7/7/78
      
      PURPOSE:  This extracts a file title from an input  string,  and
         returns  a  file_id  string containing the text of the title.
         Use  of  this  routine  localizes  knowledge  of  the  system
         dependent format of a file title.
      
      USAGE:
      
         EXTERNAL FUNCTION PR_FILE_ID
               ( LINE: CMDLINE;
                 VAR IDX: CMDLINEIDX;
                 VAR FID: FILE_ID      ): BOOLEAN;
      
      INPUT:
      
         LINE        is the line to be scanned.
      
         IDX         is  parsing  cursor.  It  is  assumed  that  this
                     points to  the  first  character  of  the  title.
                     Leading white space is not ignored.
      
      OUTPUT:
      
         IDX         is set to the first character past the end of the
                     file title if a valid  title  is  found.  If  the
                     title   is   incorrectly  formed,  this  is  left
                     pointing to the character that is in error.
      
         FID         is set to the text of the title, if a valid title
                     is found; otherwise, it is left unchanged.
      
         <return value>
                     is  true  if  a complete and well-formed title is
                     found; false, otherwise.
