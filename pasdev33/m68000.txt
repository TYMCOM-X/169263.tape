              1.1 Code Generator Design Notes


                  Description:  Preliminary documentation will be written to describe the  form  and
                               use of code generator data structures, and to outline the fundamental
                               procedures that will  be  needed  to  do  code  generation.  Detailed
                               algorithms will not be provided -- this document provides a framework
                               for the code generator, but no more.  (Some sections will be  written
                               by Steve Medlin.)

                  Progress -- 12/17/81

                      We've decided not to try using Neil Krone's simple  transfer  program  because
                      Motorola's  official  transfer  program with error checking and retransmission
                      capability is available.  This will undoubtably take longer to get up  because
                      of  its  increased  complexity  but may eliminate the need for writing our own
                      later.  The start of this task has been delayed for two reasons.  First,  Neil
                      Krone  must  obtain some missing components of the transfer program.  Second I
                      wanted to establish the initial library, with initialization  routine,  before
                      starting  on the transfer task.  The initialization routine will make creation
                      of test harnesses much easier for others working on the runtime.


                  Progress -- 1/11/82

                      Motorola's file transfer  program  works  in  "transparent"  mode  after  some
                      patches  to  the  VERSAdos operating system were applied.  The next step is to
                      get the downloading of printable ASCII files to the EXORmacs working.


                  Progress -- 1/12/82

                      Transfer of printable ASCII files is working.

                      Modified both ends of the transfer program  to  enable  transfer  of  VERSAdos
                      object  files  to  the  EXORmacs.  Object file transfers are now working.  The
                      remaining steps are to  get  file  transfers  working  from  TYMSHARE  and  to
                      document how to use the transfer programs.

                               the ideas involved in the proposed scheme  for  sharing  code  on  an

                      I  calling  this routine done, but somewhere down the line it will undoubtably
                      have to be rewritten.  This has become apparent as we've  learned  more  about
                      the   OEM  version  of  VERSados.  However,  before  the  final  form  of  the
                      initialization routine can be determined we'll have  to  find  out  even  more
                      about OEM VERSados.  The present routine will enable work to proceed.

                          Using the EXORmacs system at the local Motorola sales office, a modem, and
                          my ADM terminal, with the Motorola editor in line mode, I have  set  up  a
                          file  of  literals to be used not only on textfile association, but on all
                          phases of the I/O runtime project.  These include all literals  needed  to
                          address  a  file  block,  and  the  values  of  MDSI  Pascal standard type
                          IO_ERROR.

                          When the Text File Association part of the I/O  runtime  is  complete,  it
                          will  not  be  testable  until  the  code for some rudimentary writing and
                          reading of files is completed.  If this happens substantially  before  the
                          NEW routine is available, a NEW routine will have to be dummied up for the
                          testing.

                          I have devised a method of parsing a string passed in to  the  association
                          routines and extracting a resource name acceptable to VERSAdos.


                      Progress -- 12/3/81

                          I  badly  underestimated  this  task.  Several  factors contributed to the
                          underestimate.  A minor contribution came from  an  underestimate  of  the
                          difficulty  of using the Motorola editor in line mode.  Having an EXORmacs
                          system in house will make possible use of the editor in page mode,  which,
                          because  it  was the intended mode for this editor, and has been in use by
                          many other people, has had most of  the  bugs  worked  out  of  it.  Also,
                          having  the EXORmacs in house will greatly increase its availability.  The
                          greatest factor was that I did not realize how much was  involved  in  the
                          task.  Perhaps  it  would  have  been  better  to  leave the resource name
                          parsing and all its ramifications for later,  and  pony  up  some  minimum
                          parsing  function for this task only.  At any rate, I have rescheduled the
                          entire task, and I am further breaking the task down as follows:

                          Description:  Without a NEW function, this involves creating  and  working
                                       with  a  very few file blocks at fixed locations.  What is to
                                       be done is to create file blocks which contain IOS blocks and
                                       FHS  blocks  which  VERSAdos  will  buy.  This  also involves
                                       finding out how to treat logical unit numbers,  how  VERSAdos
                                       reacts  to such things as lower case letters in resource name
                                       strings, and generally how to work with VERSAdos.

                              I have made less progress than  I  had  hoped  on  the  EXORmacs.  The
                              EXORmacs  has  been  flaky since it was delivered, and it has not been
                              uncommon to lose several hours worth of editted data.  I am doing more
                              frequent  SAVEs  and  backup  procedures  have  been  instituted which
                              alleviate this somewhat.  Chasing and recovering  from  system  errors
                              has  taken much too much time.  We now know more about how to recover,
                              and have a good logging system, both of which will free up more time.

                              T.OPEN is coded, but gets assembler syntax errors which I believe  are
                              related  to the way static storage is declared.  The error numbers are
                              listed in the manual as "RELOCATION  OF  BYTE  FIELD  ATTEMPTED",  and
                              "SYNTAX  ERROR".  These  errors  occur  on lines which refer to static
                              variables.  T.RESET is a call to T.OPEN followed by a call to T.GET.

                          in a static map.
                      I.DISPUN Marks a unit not used in the static map.
                      I.CHKVAL Checks whether the file variable passed in has been associated with a
                          file, and, if so, whether there was a previous fatal error on the file.
                      I.RETRY To be used when another routine finds an  error.  Checks  whether  the
                          file  was  associated  with  the "retry" option, and, if not, signaals the
                          error.

              5.1 Statement level operators


                  Description:  Development of the module M68GEN,  which  is  invoked  by  PASS4  to
                               compile  an  entire  source  module.  M68GEN contains all routines to
                               control the overall progress of code generation, down to the level of
                               generating  the specific code for many statement tuples, and invoking
                               routines in other modules for the remainder.  The groups of  routines
                               involved are:

                                1. High-level control
                                2. Control  of  generation  within  a single procedure, function, or
                                   mainline
                                3. Management of basic  blocks;  temporary  storage  allocation  and
                                   deallocation
                                4. Code  generation for those statement tuples not complex enough to
                                   require their own modules

              7.1 Object File Analyzer


                  Description: The  Object  File Analyzer is a stand-alone program that reads in the
                               relocatable object file generated by the Pascal compiler, breaks  its
                               contents  up into their logical records, and prints out the values of
                               each of the component fields of these logical records.

                          No change.  I can't tell how long one of the routines (emt_fixup) is going
                          to take, nor whether I'm supposed to code it or if someone else  is  going
                          to.

                          Due to illness the week before Christmas vacation, and a long vacation, it
                          appears that this section is about 2 weeks behind schedule.

                               formed.  Important items will include:

                                1. Dividing the RDLIB routines to be written between S.  Kennedy and
                                   myself,
                                2. Determining  the  format  of  reference documentation and in-code
                                   documentation,
                                3. Begin coding.

                      Most of the routines were divided up between Steve Kennedy and myself.  I will
                      be coding the DTIME routines and JOBNUM to start with.  Others were left until
                      we get a better idea of how long it will take each of us to code the  ones  we
                      have.  A  file  was  set up on the M68000 system (1002..RDLIBHDR.SA) that is a
                      template of general in-code  documentation.  It  was  decided  that  reference
                      documentation would use the same format as the VAX RDLIB documentation.

                      The  documentation  for  the RDLIB Day/Time routines has been written.  All of
                      the routines have been coded and assembled except DC_DAYS and EC_DAYS.  I have
                      begun  testing  some of the routines.  I missed approximately a day and a half
                      due to snow/illness, but I think I should finish by 2/12.

              10.1 Intro to the M68000 and RDLIB


                  Description: At  the  present I can not put much detail into my schedule as to the
                               specific tasks I will have.  For the near future the following  items
                               are topics in which I will be involved:

                                1. Learning  about  the current RDLIB routines on both the DEC10 and
                                   the VAX;
                                2. Finding out which RDLIB routines ANC uses;
                                3. Learning the M68000 Assembler;
                                4. Studying the relevant M68000 Spec documents;
                                5. Determining a priority  (or  order)  for  working  on  the  RDLIB
                                   routines  that  will  be  needed,  and  expand  this  schedule in
                                   accordance with the determined order.


                                 Start       Completion                               __________    __________

                  Scheduled:     11/30/81    1/4/82

                  Actual:        11/30/81    1/4/82


                  Progress -- 1/4/82


                       1. The available documentation on RDLIB has been read.









          M68000 Project Progress Report                                                     Page 66
          Feburary 16 1982


                       2. It will most likely be more efficient for us to come up with our own  list
                          of  routines  we know ANC uses and present this list to ANC for review and
                          modification.  There are some (perhaps many) items that will  have  to  be
                          discussed with ANC to determine what they "need" and what will be possible
                          to provide.

                       3. I have read and gone over both the  M68000  16-Bit  Microprocessor  User's
                          Manual and the Resident Structured Assembler Reference Manual.

                       4. I  have  read  the  M68000 design documents that have been distributed and
                          have a general understanding of them.

                       5. Once we come up with our list of RDLIB routines for ANC  a  more  specific
                          schedule  for  studying,  coding, implementing, and testing these routines
                          will be determined.





              10.2 RDLIB Development Procedure


                  Description: I plan to draw up a procedure that will  be  used  in  investigating,
                               documenting (for both the M68000 RDLIB User Documentation and Program
                               Notebook Documentation), coding,  and  testing  of  individual  RDLIB
                               routines.  This  is being done so that a standard procedure exists in
                               the development process, with the goals being  consistancy  in  RDLIB
                               development.

                      The  procedure  has  been  put  together  and  SCRMAC  input  can  be found in
                      (PASDEV32)M68PRO.PMF.  A copy will be given to SMR and PJP.




              10.3 Outline RDLIB


                  Description: This task will involve putting together a document  which  lists  the
                               RDLIB  routines  to  be  implemented  on  the  M68000,  and  a  brief
                               description of each routine.  Included in the description will be  an
                               indication  of  the  language that was used to code the corresponding
                               routine on the VAX, whether the routine is system dependent,  and  if
                               the routine can be coded as previously speced, or if some part of the
                               spec needs to be defined.  Also included in the same document will be
                               a list of issues that will have to be discussed with ANC to determine
                               their needs, and determine whether we can meet those needs  directly,
                               through some viable alternative, or not at all.

                      I  was  absent  from  work  due  to illness and severe weather conditions from
                      1/6 thru 1/11, as a result this task was rescheduled as shown above.

              10.4 Standard Macros


                  Description: Macros used in assembly coding are needed to insure that the standard
                               sequences as described in the  Runtime  Specification  are  followed.
                               This  will  also  make  it  convenient  if for some reason any of the
                               standard sequences have to be changed.

                      The macros to be used in the assembly language  coding  of  RDLIB  subroutines
                      have  been  written  and  put  in the file 1002..RDLIBMAC.SA.  The actual work
                      involved was less than originally expected  (accounting  for  being  ahead  of
                      schedule).  Once I understood how the the entry and exit sequences are handled
                      by the compiler the writting of the macros was rather  easy.  Also,  I  waited
                      until  all  the  macros  were  written before I entered the code, thus all the
                      sub-tasks below were completed on the same day.  (Friday 1/22/82).

                  Progress -- 1/27/82

                      A number of bugs were found in the macros once we  started  assembling - those
                      bugs  have  been  fixed.  In  addition,  I have added a number of other macros
                      besides the three macros listed  below.  Added  to  the  macro  file  are  the
                      following new macros:

                       1. RD$ADD_BLANK  this macro is used by RD$PGM_BLK to pad the end of filenames
                                   less than six characters out to six characters.

                       2. RD$PGM_BLK  this macro sets up the program block for the module (file).

                       3. RD$MODULE  this macro sets up the beginning of the module with a  standard
                                   sequence of assembler directives and also sets up some convenient
                                   symbols.

              10.5 Scheduling RDLIB Development


                  Description: A  schedule  for the writing of the RDLIB routines will be formed and
                               documented.  This document will also include areas where  1) problems

                               needed, or 3) consultation is needed.  The  schedule  document,  upon
                               completion, will be translated to put in this schedule.

                      RDLIB subroutine development can be sufficiently done in the schedule  itself.
                      The scheduling of RDLIB development will begin in the next task section.




              10.6 RDLIB Subroutine Development


                  Description:   This  task  involves  the documentation, coding, and testing of the
                               subroutines in the RDLIB Package.  The development  of  each  routine
                               will  be done as outlined in (PASDEV32)M68PRO.TXT.  Only a portion of

                               scheduled as the library is built.

                      K. Palgut and I met today to talk about RDLIB.  Items discussed were:

                       1. Header for the RDLIB Assembly source code.  [KMP]
                       2. M68000 RDLIB Documentation
                            a. User Documentation.
                            b. Macros to be used in doing User Documentation.  [SMK]
                            c. Program Notebook Documentation.
                       3. Dividing up the responsibilities of RDLIB Delelopment

                      My part of RDLIB will be documented as we divide up the routines for RDLIB.

                      Description: Documentation of RDLIB will be a continuous task and will be done
                                   as routines are implemented.  Before  any  documentation  can  be
                                   done  there  are  three sub-tasks that need to be completed; they
                                   are listed below.

                          the M68000 RDLIB routines may begin.



                      10.6.1.1 Setting Up M68LIB.PMF


                          Description: M68LIB.PMF  will  be  the  user  documentation  for the RDLIB
                                       Package [SCRMAC input].  The  file  must  be  set  up  before

                      10.6.1.2 RDLIB User Documentation Macros


                          Description: The  user documentation for the M68000 RDLIB will all be done
                                       in a standard format.  To aid in adhering  to  this  standard
                                       format  I will write a set of PMF macros that will correspond
                                       to the standard items found  in  a  routine's  documentation.
                                       These macros will include:

                                       #ENTRY  gives entry point name;

                                      The macros listed above have been written and tested.  The PMF
                                      library  file  compiled  from  the  macros  has  been  put  in

                                      and PASDEV32.  This file should be used  as  the  PMF  library
                                      file  when  running  SCRMAC on a file which uses these macros.
                                      An example using the above macros can be  found  in  the  file

                                      This  tast  will  entail more work than originally thought.  I
                                      will have to put together a BNF representation for the  M68000
                                      file  formats.  This  BNF  representation  wwill  then  be run

                                      Because the long range plans for the 68000  are  uncertain  at
                                      this  point  spending  the extra time to implement a different
                                      scheme for evaluating elementary  is  not  warranted.  If  the
                                      68000 is ever to be used heavily, an alternative to the CORDIC
                                      function evaluation routines should probably be used.
