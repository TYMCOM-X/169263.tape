     SYSTEM:  PASDIR Directory Manipulation Routines
     
     STARTED:  10/30/78
     
     PURPOSE:  This routine returns the next file in a directory in a
        string format.
     
     USAGE:
     
        external procedure DIR_NEXT
          ( var ERR: DIR_ERRORS;
            INT_ID: DIR_INT_ID;
            var FNAME: DIR_FNAME );
     
     INPUT:
     
        INT_ID      is  the index identifying the directory, returned
                    from DIR_OPEN.
     
     OUTPUT:
     
        FNAME       is a string containing the name of the next  file
                    in the directory.  If the error return (below) is
                    DIR_OK, the string will always contain a  period,
                    even  if  the  file  contains a null extension or
                    file name.
     
        ERR         is the scalar error code.  Possible returns  are:
                    (1)  DIR_OK  -  the  name  of  the  next  file is
                    contained in  FNAME;  (2)  DIR_BAD_INT_ID  -  the
                    index   INT_ID  is  out  of  range  or  otherwise
                    invalid; (3) DIR_NOT_OPEN  -  there  is  no  open
                    directory  associated  with INT_ID; (4) DIR_EOF -
                    the end of the directory file has  been  reached,
                    and FNAME is the null string.
     
     REQUIREMENTS:  none.
     
     NOTES:   Notice  that  the  end of directory return (DIR_EOF) is
        taken on the call AFTER the one returning the  last  file  in
        the directory.
