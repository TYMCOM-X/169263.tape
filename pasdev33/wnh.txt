                              Using the EXORmacs system at the local Motorola sales office, a modem,
                              and my ADM terminal, with the Motorola editor in line mode, I have set
                              up a file of literals to be used not only on textfile association, but
                              on all phases of the I/O runtime project.  These include all  literals
                              needed to address a file block, and the values of MDSI Pascal standard
                              type IO_ERROR.

                              When the Text File Association part of the I/O runtime is complete, it
                              will  not  be testable until the code for some rudimentary writing and
                              reading of files is completed.  If this happens  substantially  before
                              the NEW routine is available, a NEW routine will have to be dummied up
                              for the testing.

                              I have devised  a  method  of  parsing  a  string  passed  in  to  the
                              association  routines  and  extracting  a  resource name acceptable to
                              VERSAdos.

                              I badly underestimated this task.  Several factors contributed to  the
                              underestimate.  A minor contribution came from an underestimate of the
                              difficulty of using the  Motorola  editor  in  line  mode.  Having  an
                              EXORmacs  system in house will make possible use of the editor in page
                              mode, which, because it was the intended mode for this editor, and has
                              been  in use by many other people, has had most of the bugs worked out
                              of it.  Also, having the EXORmacs in house will greatly  increase  its
                              availability.  The greatest factor was that I did not realize how much
                              was involved in the task.  Perhaps it would have been better to  leave
                              the  resource  name  parsing  and all its ramifications for later, and
                              pony up some minimum parsing function  for  this  task  only.  At  any
                              rate,  I  have  rescheduled the entire task, and I am further breaking
                              the task down as follows:

                                  Description:  Without a NEW function, this involves  creating  and
                                               working   with  a  very  few  file  blocks  at  fixed
                                               locations.  What is to be  done  is  to  create  file
                                               blocks  which contain IOS blocks and FHS blocks which
                                               VERSAdos will buy.  This also  involves  finding  out
                                               how  to  treat  logical  unit  numbers,  how VERSAdos
                                               reacts to  such  things  as  lower  case  letters  in
                                               resource name strings, and generally how to work with
                                               VERSAdos.

                                      I have made less progress than I had hoped  on  the  EXORmacs.
                                      The EXORmacs has been flaky since it was delivered, and it has
                                      not been uncommon to lose several hours worth of editted data.
                                      I am doing more frequent SAVEs and backup procedures have been
                                      instituted  which  alleviate  this   somewhat.   Chasing   and
                                      recovering  from  system  errors has taken much too much time.
                                      We now know more about how to recover, and have a good logging
                                      system, both of which will free up more time.

                                      T.OPEN  is  coded,  but  gets  assembler syntax errors which I
                                      believe are related to the way  static  storage  is  declared.
                                      The  error  numbers are listed in the manual as "RELOCATION OF
                                      BYTE FIELD ATTEMPTED", and "SYNTAX ERROR".  These errors occur
                                      on  lines  which refer to static variables.  T.RESET is a call
                                      to T.OPEN followed by a call to T.GET.

                          file, and, if so, whether there was a previous fatal error on the file.
                      I.RETRY To be used when another routine finds an  error.  Checks  whether  the
                          file  was  associated  with  the "retry" option, and, if not, signaals the
