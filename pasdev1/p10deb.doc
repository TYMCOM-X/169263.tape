#system (PASCAL compiler)
#module (P10DEB,4/1/79)
Emission of DEBUG and TRACE supports.
#ENTRY (DEB_INIT)initializes the data structures and reserves locations
for the program block.
#entry (TRACE_BLOCK)emits the trace block.
#entry (PROG_BLOCK)emits the program block.
#entry (STMT_BLOCK)emits statement blocks and sets up definitions for page and file blocks.
#entry (BLK_END)insures that forward statement pointers from trace blocks are resolved.
#entry (FP_BLOCKS)dumps the page and file blocks.
#entry (DEB_STABLE)directs the symbol table dump for the PASCAL debugger.
#effects
Since some symbol table entries are modified during the dump P10DEB must be called
after code emission is PASS4.
#algorithm
The compiler symbol table is a complex structure on the heap comprised of
block, symbol, type, value and name nodes.
This structure is walked in three passes, starting from the root block and
following all relevent pointers.
The nodes are visited in the same order in all three passes.
The first or initialization pass sets the "self" pointer of each node to
NIL and its Boolean "visited" flag to false. In the second pass each node
is assigned an address offset from zero which will be its word offset in
the symbol table file when it is dumped.
This address is stored in its self pointer and the visited flag is set
true in preparation for the third pass.
Finally, each node is copied field by field into a simplified version

of the record for the debugger, replacing all pointers by their self addresses,
and written to the symbol table file.
The visied flag is then set false to indicate that the node has been processed.
#notes
Not all symbols are emitted. In particular named types, indirect types, and
standard procedures and functions are deleted from the "sym_list"s during the first pass.
Name nodes which are not required (not "visited" in the second pass) are
deleted from the name tree prior to the third pass.
$skip
In emission of file and page blocks, three fields in the PAGE_ID records
are redefined since they are otherwise unused in the fourth pass.
The "following_page" pointer for the first page of a file holds the
"def" pointer for the file's "file_block". 
Each page for which a page_block is to be emitted has the "def" pointer
for this block stored in the "left_page" field of its page_id record,
while the "right_page" field holds the def pointer of the last "stmt"
block emitted for the page. These are initialized to NIL by DEB_INIT,
assigned by STMT_BLOCK, and resolved by FP_BLOCKS.
