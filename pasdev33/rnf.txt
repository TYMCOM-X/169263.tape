              1.1 Code Generator Design Notes


                  Description:  Preliminary documentation will  be  written
                               to   describe  the  form  and  use  of  code
                               generator data structures,  and  to  outline
                               the  fundamental  procedures  that  will  be
                               needed  to  do  code  generation.   Detailed
                               algorithms  will  not  be  provided  -- this
                               document provides a framework for  the  code
                               generator, but no more.  (Some sections will
                               be written by Steve Medlin.)

                                 Start       Completion                               __________    __________

                  Progress --12/7/81

                      Most sections of the design  notes  are  complete.  A
                      section   is   still   needed  on  the  treatment  of
                      multiple-use expressions.

              1.2 Pass 1


                  Description:  The type and storage allocation tables,  as
                               well  as  the  miscellaneous  target machine
                               constants,   must   be   defined   in    the
                               initialization pass.

                      The  initialization pass (M68INI) has been completed.
                      Programs may be processed by the analysis pass, using
                      the  :TARGET  M68  command.  Only  the code generator
                      remains to be written.




              1.3 Register Allocation


                  Description:  Coding of low-level  utility  routines  for
                               register allocation (specified in the Design
                               Notes).
